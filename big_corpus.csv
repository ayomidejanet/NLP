Greedyvision and IW basically screwed us all with the (purely monetary) decision to drop dedicated servers ($).  The game requires Steam ($) so no resales or trading.  The up front price is ridiculous ($) for any PC game, even a hotly-anticipated, outstanding title (which this one MIGHT have been).  No modding allowed ($) so they can charge for lots of (tiny) expansions.

All the ($) really killed this game.  It is of course easy to get a superior product through piracy, but that is typical these days. Pirated versions allow you to do what the game should have allowed.  The price gouging and crippled features will simply drive more people to find the pirated version, rather than preventing it.  It's called 'killing the golden goose'.  Activision has done a fine job murdering this poor waterfowl through pure avarice and a complete disregard for buyer's wants.

I'd really have difficulty believing anyone that gave this one more than three stars, and would view those reviews with a good bit of suspicion.

Now remove everything that was great about it, add a portentous and dull reading of American history, bad acting, a 10 hour escort mission, and about five thousand trashcans. That's Bioshock Infinite.

I have to admit with frustration that I didn't bother finishing it, despite the money I spent on it. Life is too short and I have GTAV waiting, so I quit after about 6 hours of looting trashcans. I hate quitting games I've started, I always really feel like I have to see it through to the end. But this one took the biscuit.

The game is a drag. It almost never, ever comes together. I was excited exactly once, when I first flew up to Columbia. The first sky hook mission was pretty cool. But everything else? A sorry, empty, atmosphere-less drag. This huge city in the sky? It's empty. No-one's in it. Except the people who want to shoot you. And they're boring.

The game has zero tension, zero suspense, zero atmosphere, zero emotion - believe me, just zero. All those other people who say how great the game is? I'm telling you, they were smoking crack when they played it.

The story telling in this game is pathetically poor. I had been playing for a few hours, when I decided to consult an online walkthrough and discovered that my character had been a detective before going up to Columbia. WHAT? I had no idea! That would explain those annoying black and white flashbacks that pop up occasionally and make no sense

Most soap operas are constructed better and have more believable characters. Booker De Witt? One-note tough-guy dork with furrowed brow. EXACTLY the guy on the cover, by the way.

What about the actual gameplay - the action? The weapons feel generic, and it matters barely a squat what you shoot with, as the enemy AI is so poor that you're basically herding bulletsponges. It bored me senseless. Anyone playing this game for the action is either a masochist or, again, smoking crack.

Apart from spending my time shooting, what else did I do?

What I mainly did in Bioshock Infinite was loot trashcans. Because that's pretty much all there is to do in this amazing alternate reality they cooked up for 150 million bucks. Trashcans that contain food (sometimes), ammo (usually), and coins. There are lots of wooden boxes to search too. And lunch boxes. But mainly trashcans.

If you want a great game about saving a woman, get Dishonoured. That's got some great atmosphere, some great moves out of the first Bioshock playbook, and very compelling gameplay. Or just replay the original Bioshock. It's 7 years old but it's still pretty great.",Bioshock: Infinite Trashcans,1401062400,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

What that means is I can not hook it up to a tv. I can still get sound from a PC but since the analog wires are fixed to the dongle I can not use it for the PS3 or Xbox. On the PC the sound is going through USB.

The sound has also started cutting out. The sound will randomly cut out if no one is speaking. For example lets say I'm listening to a podcast or tv show and someone is speaking and there is also music playing. If the person stops speaking all sound also stops including the music. When they start talking all sounds starts up but with annoying popping sound. This is completely random.

The headphones hurt my ears after a short time wearing them. Could be because I have large head. Had to order a special helmet for me when I played football.

I can not believe how bad the beginning of this game is.  It ruined the game for me.  By the time I got to my first fight, roughly two hours in, I was already ready to trade the game in for something....anything else.
You will spend the first couple hours of this game slowly walking from one part of the map to another.  You get to one side, someone tells you to go to the other.  You get to the other, someone tells you to go back.  You do this over and over.
The mechanics of the game this early are also horrible.  At one point you need to go to a house on cliff and the path to the house is hidden between two houses.  At another point you have to lay 3 stone pieces on a column.  There is no button to lay them, so I had to move the stone pieces around for ever until the game decides the are in the proper place and it lays them for you.  This is maddening when the pieces are perfectly lined up, yet the game will not place them.  And I kept going until I got to that first fight, hoping the game would get better with the battles.  But it doesn't.  The system in antiquated.
But the worst thing about the beginning of the game is that you are stuck with two of the worst characters I have ever encountered in a game as party members.  Keifer is a spoiled brat who is one of the reasons you are running all over the map.  You are basically his slave, disguised as a ""friend"".  He is annoying.  Super annoying.  But he is the most awesome character ever compared to Maribel.  Honestly, if the game let me, I would kill her, reload, kill her again, reload, kill her again.  That seems to me to be the only possible enjoyment this game could offer.  She pops up univited, forces herself into your party, and never misses an opportunity to tell you what a giant jerk you are.  Seriously, it is constant.

Maybe the game eventually turns into this ""charming masterpiece"" so many people claim it to be.  But I read it takes 20+ hours before you can even choose a class.  And honestly, the ""slave"" class you seem to start in got tiresome before the first, simplistic battle.
But I refuse to go deeper.  I refuse to play a game that saddles me with two of the most annoying characters ever.

They've taken the skeleton of the much more fun and fast-paced arcade games like Smackdown: HCTP & others which were made YEARS AND YEARS ago and unsuccessfully tried to slow them down and feel more like a simulation game.  It fails at both, and is a terrible Frankensteined in-between system that is just awful.

They're too cheap and lazy to start over with a truly original set of mechanics and animations.  The hit detection is a joke, everyone just floats around in a sludge-like manner.  You don't feel like you are controlling your character and actually wrestling, as much as just executing a set of poor animations.

The stamina system is pretty silly.  You can be dominating a match, but then have to watch your character go through a ridiculous heavy-breathing animation that locks you out of control until their stamina refills.  Often times your opponent, who you just performed a move on, recovers before you do.  Unless of course, you do boring and poorly animated ""resting"" submission holds.  Speaking of which, he submission system in this game is broken, all the way.

So many aspects of this game are tied to ridiculous looking pop-up mini-games and quick-time button presses that don't even make sense with the slowed down ""sim"" feel they are trying to go for.  It's high time the developers made brand new set of animations & mechanics for these games.  If they want to rip off past games, please take from the much better AKI engine games like No Mercy.

I won't waist my time and yours repeating what has already been said.  But yes Blizzard makes you jump through many hoops and then tightens the hoops around your neck.  They treat the paying public like criminals who buy their products and who made their company.  I have a comment about that, ""don't bite the hand that feeds you.""  The large price for a game that is only 1/3 complete with only the terrain part of the game, and the fact that you have to be connected to the internet to play the game, to get any more maps, and to get your game saves/stats, etc.  Also, you can never reset your account it is the same for life unless you pay for another copy of the game, plus you can only play with people in your region, period.  And yes, one must be connected to the internet to play the full installed version of the game.  If you are not connected the game does not have full features.  AND every 4 weeks you must connect to your online account or your game will shut down, and that's for the life of the game.  Also, the Blizzard server saves and compiles data and all your stats from the game whether you want it or not; and it stays as part of your account for the life of your game and you can not change or reset it without buying another copy of the game.  Also, for small extra online addons here and there you will pay and pay again if you want them.

All this sounds great huh?  This is borderline criminal if not criminal.  It is apparent that this industry needs to be caught up to modern times with some form of regulation.  The consumer needs privacy and protection from this kind of crap.  Phone companies can not listen in on your calls just because they made the phone, and car companies can not track you and tell you to drive the car to their home office every month so they can make sure you are doing the right thing with the car.

I think its best to stay away from this game and this company.  I will not ever buy anymore of their so called products.  And they are now releasing Diablo 3 that will be just like this.  Don't make me laugh.

I write this as a warning to those who don't know what this company is doing.  Don't waist your money.  Save yourself the hassle, the headaches, and the aggravation.  Again, I count myself lucky that I did not throw my money down the hole called Blizzard.

1.0,True,"12 19, 2017",AROI7KZTHBVP2,B014VZ5RHA,Wade,"Tedious, dull, & unforgiving, to a casual gamer.  You can turn down the difficulty level - mainly meaning reducing the effect of damage on your car - and also enable various assists (e.g. for steering, braking, etc), but alas those ultimately all combine into one of only two outcomes:  pointlessly easy because the game's basically playing itself for you, or too difficult.

In particular, even on the middle 'difficulty' (damage-sensitivity) setting, the default, the cars have the structural integrity of wet egg cartons.  Multiple times I've just nudged a length of plastic netting and had the transmission fail entirely, or the steering knocked so far out of alignment the car starts doing donuts by itself.  It's utterly ridiculous.  Real cars are *way* tougher than this game supposes.

There's also no impression of speed.  The little speedometre in the corner might say things like ""123 km/h"", but to look at the screen itself, it feels like you're barely moving.  Which compounds the frustration at the terrible handling and vehicle toughness.

Also, the game gives you a non-optional navigator which repetitively spouts gibberish nominally to inform you about upcoming turns, but more often than not by the time it comments about a turn, you're already in it - or done with it entirely - and in some races, inexplicably, there's no navigation at all.  Seemingly a straight out, intermittent bug.

Note that while there are tutorials that are supposed to explain the nomenclature & conventions of the navigator, they don't actually explain anything at all - they just put you on test courses and have you drive them as repeatedly and tiresomely as the normal races.  Baffling.

There are many other bugs & design flaws too many to cover in full here.  One last one of particular note, though:  the menu systems throughout are incomprehensible in their navigation structure - 'back' will more often than not take you to the very main screen, not actually back or up one menu, requiring tedious drilling back down as many as six levels to get to where you were.  Compounding that further is that when you do land on many of the menus, the game frequently throws up error dialogs seemingly all relating to being unable to contact some online service it wants - seemingly one that's been shut down at this point.  Which evidently isn't necessary to the actual game, yet it really wants to hassle you about it all the time regardless.

Although it is not by any means a Resident Evil game - it is a generic game based on 20 years of horror cliche that they slapped the Resident Evil / Biohazard name on to move a few more copies - it was pretty interesting at first. When you are taken hostage and then have to sneak around the house, playing in VR I was genuinely scared and creeped out.

Then you make it to the garage and burn donuts in a small room with a giant named Jack, and the whole thing falls apart.

I'm not going to go too deep into spoilers, but I have to say this is a bad game. It's dumb, it's repetitive, it is unoriginal (every horror cliche in the world is in this game - letters from your 'dead' wife, creepy town, hillbillies with questionable dietary habits, Blair Witch, torture porn, gross-out, etc. etc). There is zero replay value (is not even worth playing through once). There are no real puzzles, in fact the only mildly challenging puzzle is repeated. The environments aren't interesting, the story is dumb, the enemies are boring bullet sponges.

I honestly can't imagine why it has such a high rating on this site. And everyone keeps repeating that dumb line about ""a return to form"", which only indicates they've never played a Resident Evil game before (this is nothing like Resident Evil of the past, which is what a ""return to form"" means).

Got it today and played for a few hours, and I am HUGELY disappointed.

Though the box says that the game plays in first- and third-person perspectives, it actually uses pretty much the same perspective as Mass Effect... and I hated that!

Yes, there's a ""third-person"" perspective, but it's NOT the typical isometric view; it's a basic over-the-shoulder view that can only be adjusted for longer view distance if you use a mouse with a scroll wheel. If you use a trackball or other mouse, you're out of luck. It's as if you're standing right next to the PC shoulder-to-shoulder. It may as well just be a first-person view!

I've always hated ""shooters"", and even though there's dialogue and story line and all of that here, I just hate the first-person view; I can't tell what's going on in the area. Further, without the traditional isometric view of previous Fallouts, I find it difficult to navigate the areas. The Pip-Boy mapping system's okay, but not great, and I can't get a large enough perspective on the areas to determine where I am with reliable accuracy.

Further, Fallout 3 seems to be following a trend of tailoring PC-based games to follow the Playstation/XBox design of being key-based in operation as opposed to mouse-based; to get your PC to move or perform actions, you have to use keys. I find this INCREDIBLY slow and awkward.

I'll play it a bit more while I wait for the ""Storm of Zehir"" expansion to Neverwinter Nights 2, and if things improve I'll edit this review.... but I'm not hopeful.

Caveat Emptor!

UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE

I've now played the game for about 15 hours, and have some further observations.

If one strays from the Main Quest, the ""shooter"" aspect of the game becomes even more pronounced. Side quests are very linear, of the ""go fetch"" variety, and involve VERY heavy combat and almost nothing else.

Even the Main Quest is very simplified compared to earlier Fallouts, with none of the sublety and moral complexities in the decision-making process involving the PC that I found enjoyable in the previous versions. Conversations with NPCs are basic and linear.

The ""Local Map"" feature on the Pip-Boy is virtually useless. I can't make heads nor tails of the information displayed as it's pretty much just a jumble of meaningless symbols, unless you're in a very simple area like a tunnel.

Not everyone loved Halo 4's multiplayer but for me it was a high note of the series. The ability to select your armor ability and a customized weapons loadout permitted you to adjust to changing game conditions. H5 just feels different - you're locked into one set of armor abilities and weapons(warzone mode excluded) and now you seem to die more quickly when shot than in previous Halo games. Part of the joy of previous Halo installments was being able to adapt to a few initial shots at your shields and outwit your opponent. Perhaps now more than ever, it comes down to whom spotted whom first and strategy is limited. It's one redeeming feature is Warzone Firefight which provides some fun, but even that suffers from the aforementioned flaws. Finally, it's a shame that they removed ""couch co-op"" for the campaign and multiplayer as I enjoyed that feature.

I'm tired of kicking this football, Lucy. I keep buying these damn games hoping, ""surely this time it will be better."" The original AC came out 10 years ago and this game is essentially exactly the same. AC2 was awesome but each iteration of the game since then has simply added more gimmicks not better play.  The addition of the spider-man-magic grappling hook even takes the fun out of the parkour elements. I found myself intentionally not using it to make the game more challenging.  Whats next? Is Imhotep going to give us a flying carpet in the next game?
Just adding hundreds of redundant missions doesn't make for a compelling game. How many times do they expect us to kill the same villain sprites in slightly different locations?  How about a game where we actually have to do some recon not just kill everybody wearing red pants? How about actually needing to solve a few mysteries, make some decisions with moral ambiguity, or simply just not having every important element in the game glowing and jingling. How about missions that don't spoon feed us every step and penalize us if we don't follow some arbitrary condition?
The graphics are no better than AC2. The game play is basically identical to all. The story is a mess. We should know exactly what we need to do next to move the story along, not be giving some random mission completely out of context that has us searching the map to figure out what the hell we're supposed to be doing.

CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating ""music"" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment).

PROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced.

I think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.  If I can't turn it off, and some else controls the on-off switch, that's a problem.  Sometimes it might be worth it, but not here.  I found some entertainment value, but very briefly.

I will admit, I did buy this expecting it to okay but not great but I was in a for surprise when I loaded it up and started playing. First of all, while the graphics are subpar, it would have looked great as a PS2 game, the music and introduction got me thinking I was watching a lost episode of Game of Thrones. You create your character from a selection of rather bland character models and then you have to choose your strengths and weaknesses.

Oh yeah, I thought that was original, for a second, most RPGs allow you to select your skills and strengths but since this is Game of Thrones, it couldn't be that easy. However, the choices really cater you to become a miserable, useless, hermit-like character that you feel will die the minute you press a button or a good stiff wind will deplete your health bar. Then you have to endure reading and lots of dialogue, like in the show, except the reading part. The action begins and then you realized you wasted your money, no action, you just end up mashing buttons and giving awkward commands and watch as the game plays itself, yup, you give commands and then do nothing. Mass Effect had the RPG nailed down, you are an active participant in the game, here, you watch and wonder if you are actually playing or not.

I have played a few RPGs in my time, I understand the mechanics of turn based play where you give your character a few commands and then it executes it and then the NPC responds (Knights of the Old Republic, Breath of Fire) but this one, ugh, you feel the sloppiness of it, it is uninspiring, dull and basically realize it could have been a better game if it was developed by a better studio.

If you are a glutton for punishment, an angry video game reviewer or big fan of the show, it is a good buy, otherwise, the only way to get any enjoyment from this game is to give it to another gamer in your life and watch them suffer and get annoyed but it.

Some issures were fixed, but new ones have surfaced.  Here are some of my top hates. Most of these issues are existent from previous PC releases, so 0 stars is more appropriate since 2K didn't even bother fixing issues that have been known for years.

When moving around dribbling, no matter how high your handling skills, you will often dribble the ball onto your own foot, your defender's foot, your teammates foot.  Happens way too frequently... like every 10 plays.

Blocking by AI is insane.  My point guard is getting blocked on open jump shots or lay ups from point guards who are flying in from 5ish feet away.

AI defense is insanely good when defending you vs other AI.  If you let the AI defend against an opponent AI, it does a crappy job and usually the offensive AI drives in for an easy score.  Yet the same player when defending you will be able to counter your every move and make it near impossible for you to drive in.  Even if you're playing as K Irving, and the defender is some backup center who has chased you out to the 3 point line.

Some My Player attribute ratings are capped at under 99... still don't understand the concept of this.  My Player is suppose to be a fantasy of you becoming the best player.... why cap?

Menu system is still insanely convoluted.  Carried over from all previous 2ks.

When trying to make a pass, randomly your player just drops the ball instead and continues with the throwing animation with open hands... letting your defender take his time to pick up the ball and run by you.  Happens once or twice a game.  Also, sometimes players will try to throw the pass through other players on the court for some reason.  Obviously, this does not work and you will get a turnover.

Shot release timing is still buggy.  For some reason, My Player mode is affected more.  I have been playing with a 99 medium range shooter and I can do a perfect release and a perfect shot selection, and 80% of the time, I miss.  In association mode, using the same shot release and jump animation, with perfect release and shot selection, I hit about 50-60% of the time.  On some random shots, the game will not register you releasing the shot button so you get an F for release rating and miss the shot.

Movement on defense is still not calibrated correctly.  It's hard to explain, but you never feel like you're in precise control of the player's movement.  I think it's 2K's insistence on animation continuity.  So no matter what your speed, quickness rating is, I feel like there's a lag between your input change and your player moving in the new direction because 2k forces the animation of the previous direction to finish before it'll register the new direction. This lag in direction change is huge in basketball where split seconds count.",No improvement over 2k13,1390348800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I was considering creating a second account. As of 11-17-05 my account is cancelled. The New Game, also known as the Starter Kit, is the third version of SWG and it is riddled with bugs and incomplete. It is a far inferior product to its previous versions as well. The NG was released after being kept secret for an unknown period of time and allowing players only a two week notice of it being published. Even less time was devoted to it being tested by sources outside of SOE. Trials of Obi Wan and the NG were released in such a manner as to call into question SOE's and LA's ethics. As represented by the employees who post to the forums SOE and LA are uncarring, glib, and/or vastly out of touch with the player community.

Most of these are not new complaints. However, with the release of the NG these problems have escalted to such a degree that the game is no longer playable. While some are content to merely switch games I am not. Simply changing the direction of the flow of money to SOE and LA will not get their attention.

It will lose many current players but those will be replaced by SOE's and LA's new target market. SOE and LA will later use the negative comments and future subscriptions numbers to prove that they were right all along and to dismiss anyone who opposes them as being knee jerk reactionaries who are against change just because they don't like change.

The game tries to be a ""choose your own adventure"" samurai story set in the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate era of Japan, but completely fails. Here's why:

-Even though there are multiple paths you can take through the game, you can beat the game in about 45 min. either way. Not even most 16-bit games are that short, and those are certainly a helluva lot more fun!

-The swordfighting is boring, due to the slow pace, lack of moves, and under-evolved fighting engine. And since that's the main gameplay hook, it leaves you with little reason to play. Dynasty Warriors and Devil May Cry both sweep the floor with this one.

-There's no voice acting. Just grunting and giggling sound effects. For a game that wants to have a story, this sure is a raw deal...

-The save system is just messed up. Period. There were occasions where I'd save my game, die, and find out that my file had  mysteriously been erased. And a quick look at some of the other reviews tell me I'm not alone on this one...

-The black guy with the afro. Seriously, what the hell is this guy doing here? Maybe if he actually said something funny once in a while, it'd be pretty neat, but as it is, he has no personality, and seems to just take up space. Leave him alone.

-The game world is tiny. It consists of 9 (I think) areas, that are each about the size of a football field. For a game that wants to have adventure game elements, this totally destroys everything, and is the final nail in this game's coffin.",ARGH!,1118188800,3,,

So if you buy this game, be aware that you'll be limited to 5 activations and then you'll have to call UBISoft at your expense if you want to install it again. I don't know what UBISoft charges for phone support, but it probably isn't free.

What is an activation? Install the game, that's an activation. Change a piece of hardware, that uses an activation. Reinstall Windows without changing any hardware, that uses up an activation. You might even use up an activation upgrading a video or sound driver. Adding a USB peripheral device could use up an activation. You get 5 of these, then the game ceases to function and you'll get a message saying that you need to buy a new copy (not call them for more activations as it should say).

SecuROM has been known to give users errors or not allow an installation to occur due to CD/DVD drive incompatibility problems (usually older drives). You will typically get CRC or checksum errors while a file is being read from the drive. SecuROM also maintain a ""black list"" of processes where it won't allow the game to run if you have one of these black listed programs installed or running.

SecuROM is just plain bad news for the honest customer and to make matters worse it hasn't had much impact on piracy at all. In fact, the pirates enjoy greater freedom and far less headaches than the honest customer. Spore is a great example of why SecuROM is bad all the way around.

+ Horses feel authentic

+ A few of the quests are fun, like the riverboat ride

- The controls are absolutely hideous, even after hours of play it is cumbersome to change weapons in a fight, switch to a lasso from a weapon in order to hogtie a baddie or rope a horse.  Also it is almost impossible to navigate down a road, continue to move your horse forward, while shooting at bad guys attacking you on horseback... you just cant push all the buttons correctly.

- The targeting system is both too easy and too inaccurate.  With the auto target system i can literally kill 5 bad guys without even entering deadeye and no aiming is involved, just click click click and the baddies drop dead. That being said, if something random happens, like a bear attacks, or a group of guys decide to turn hostile, or you end up accidently being wanted in a town.... its near impossible to pull out your weapon to defend yourself.  You literally are dead by the time your weapon comes out.

- John Marton is super lame... his voice acting is retarded, he just looks silly and it really takes away from feeling like your a badass out west...

- The games quests feel forced and drawn out... like one lame thing after another to get to the next lame quest.... John Marston constantly comments on this and how long its taking and how it sucks.... and you as the player feel the same way.  Honestly... i did all the quests to kill all my old gang and now im back with my wife and kid on a farm... and im still doing lame quests waiting for the end of the game... im doing crap like killing crows eating grain out of my silo... or showing my son how to herd a pack of cows.... seriously... im not making this up...

- The world in general is very ""non-interactive.""  This game doesnt have a go anywhere do anything feel.  It is very scripted and basically each town has 3 or 4 buildings you can enter and you can talk to maybe 5 - 8 people in each town but only for the exact tasks / script that was written for them, ie doctor, poker game, gunstore owner.
The result is a feeling of... i might as well not explore because i know whats in the 4 buildings in this town and theres nothing new to see.

-  Tying into the non-interactivity is the fact that the world outside of the towns is very empty as well. Its pretty, but thats it.... there is really nothing to find or do except shoot and skin animals.

-  The WORST part of this game are the numerous bugs and glitches already discussed in detail by the games other detractors.  You will die and be transported to some random town on the map.  Your horse will float through mid air.  The game crashes, a lot for no good reason at all.  Alot of wierd and unfinished graphics show up as well.

All in all this game just isn't that fun... its super limited in scope with a kind of lame story and horrible voice acting and is buggy as hell...

I got the game in the mail. I popped the disc into my 360, and got some Cool Ranch Doritos from downstairs, along with a tall glass of ice cold water. I sat down to play some MW3. The very first screen I see is the same exact screen that MW2 presented me with... A selection between Spec Ops, Multiplayer, or the Campaign. I went straight into some TDM because that was the game mode that I have always enjoyed the most.

Anyway, after a few rounds, I really struggled to continue playing. For one, the maps are absolutely horrible. I started in the map Bakara or whatever it was called, and I instantly felt that the map was too cramped. After a few more maps, I noticed that they were extremely cramped too, unlike the majority of CoD4 or MW2 maps. This meant only one thing. Corner campers. And my god are there a lot of them. In my 3rd game 75% of the time I was killed was by someone sitting in a corner trying to blend into the map, waiting for me to run and kill me. I thought Kill Confirmed (the game mode) would fix this so I tried it out. Boy, was I wrong. People camped even more than in TDM. Basically what they did was kill you while camping and let the tag stay on the floor. Then someone from your teem tries to pick the tag up, and they get mowed down. When there are like 4 tags on the ground, he picks them up and find a new spot to camp. Ground War was no different. People camping in corners waiting for you to run by and kill you.

I found the guns in the game to be absolute garbage as well. Not only do your guns start out extremely underpowered, but you need to work to level them up. I don't know about you, but I dislike this. Why does it take me 7 shots to kill someone when they can kill me with 2? That's not all. The guns just feel like rebranded guns from MW2 with new sounds. There was this one gun that looked like the FAMAS... And guess what, it was a three round burst gun just like the FAMAS. Hell, I bet IW copy and pasted the FAMAS script with a new sound and called it a new gun. Took them like 2-3 minutes to make a decal, and then done.

Graphics... Not much to say here. They look the same as MW2's graphics. And CoD4's. You would think that after 4 years they would improve them. No, that's unacceptable, because that requires extra work, and extra work is un-American. I'm only kidding, but seriously? The graphics really need to get updated. They look worse than BC2's graphics on low at 800x600 on the PC.

I don't think I have ever wanted to stop playing a game more before in my life. I tried to like it, I really did, but the game to me was a lot worse than CoD4 and MW2. It was even worse than Black Ops. Yeah. I went there.

Okay, that was the end of my review that I copy/pasted from my old review. To wrap it up, this game is 100% garbage. I don't know how people continue to play this garbage. It's the same boring game CoD4 and MW2 presented you with, only they made it much, MUCH worse. If I ever want to play CoD again, I will buy MW2, not this garbage. What a waste of money.

I had been anticipating this game way back at E3 of last year, when Randy Pitchford, hype man of Gearbox, introduced the first playable demo of Aliens: Colonial Marines.  What a difference a year makes.  This is bar-none, the worst Xbox 360 game I have ever played.  Yes, the graphics are shockingly subpar, the storyline is uninspired, and the animation is clunky.  But what really ticks me off is how a game so disturbingly unpolished was even allowed to be released in the first place.  Case one is the atrocious amount of screen tearing in the Xbox 360 version of the game.  It's everywhere, even in the cut scenes.  Case two is the blatant misrepresentation of how this game was going to look and play.  ACM is definately not the version of the game I saw in the demo.  Whole levels and cut scenes have either been restructered for the worse or ommitted altogether.  The creepy ambient lighting that was hyped is practically non-existent, replaced by a dull, gray glow.  What's left seems like an early beta version of the game that was scrapped together with a $1.50 budget.  I could go on and on about how abysmal this game is, but quite frankly, the reviewers below me have thoroughly done a good job describing this game's faults.  So will there be a game that does this property justice?  Given this title, it's hard to say considering that this was supposed to be the ultimate Aliens gaming experience.  What I can promise is that I will never fall for the hype of an Aliens game until it is released.","In space, no one can hear you scream for your money back...",1360800000,9,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

As some others have mentioned, it's impossible to hit anyone in the game and I find it so annoying that you either use the classic controls, which don't feel complete, or the new controls which are horrible.

The AI in this game is much better, but honestly, it even on Rookie I find myself taking 100 shots and still in close games, where the computer scores on 1/8 shots, which is ridiculous.  You really have to use all of the controls, including the dekes and I can't stand it.  I can't play the game enough to get used to a new system and wanted something more arcade-like, like NHL used to be.  For those who want a sim, this might be great, but otherwise it, to be frank, sucks.

Your receivers will continuously get knocked of their route 15 yards down the field and the D will get an easy pick. Speaking of easy picks, the Defenses may as well be super human. They will break coverage when their back is turned and be on your receiver before the ball gets there every time. They will leap in the air and intercept a ball with their back turned. The ball will go straight through your receiver, who makes zero effort to catch it, and into the hands of a defender. Lineman can close a 10 yard gap faster than you can throw a ball 5 yards.

I tried to play career mode and found it nothing but frustrating. Your player, supposedly the #1 draft prospect may as well play for a high school team. You also get no help from your AI team mates. RB's will juke away from an open hole and run straight into your lineman, or they will run backwards. Your receiver, even stars in the NFL, can not catch. Balls will hit them in the hands and fall to the ground. If they do catch it they get separated form the ball on the first hit.

I played a game against a friend and it seemed to play a whole lot different. We both threw multiple BS interceptions however.

I didn't by this game just to play every once in a while with friends. I bought it so I could enjoy some football during the off season. I have found no enjoyment in this game.

UPDATE MARCH 4TH, 2012

This is the first time I do an update on a review and the reason it's very simple, the idea behind this product it's good, but the design it's just wrong, after checking the temperature on my PS3 after playing 5 hours straight using this product, it was boiling hot, the back of my PS3 was extremely hot, so I decided to unplugged the ""cooler"". On a different day I played for another 5 straight hours with out the cooler, and the PS3 was warm, not hot as the day before. On both occasions I've had the PS3 on top of a laptop cooler, and the entertainment center is open on the back and front, so there's a good flow of air. I guess this product would be better if it had larger and faster fans like the modifications on the picture.

So my recommendation it's to place the PS3 on top of a laptop cooler, this gives a good flow of air to the intakes on the PS3, and also have it in a well ventilated area. My first PS3, 80 gig fat, lasted almost four years, and I used it for everything, now this one I just use for video games., so it should last a while longer than the first.",NOT GOOD AFTER A WHILE,1329004800,,,

1.0,False,"07 1, 2008",AEOAMS0G96E8B,B00113JSCG,Paul Arellano,"I've been reviewing games for Amazon since 1999. I've seen the worst of games...Daikatana, most especially. Now, after many moons have passed, I have come across one of the worst, if not, the buggiest, most annoying piece of program I have ever encountered in my life. Alone in the Dark is a major disaster, from it's storyline, dialogue, annoying voice acting, frustrating controls, unforgiving checkpoints, and the most buggiest collision detection EVER! The only PLUS in this game are the graphics but that's about it. So I'll keep my review straight and to the point:

GRAPHICS: Excellent. No complaints

CONTROLS: Main character moves like a tank with a bad engine. Controls are completely unresponsive. Some buttons do not function as stated. For example, you press A to turn off a flashlight. If you're holding a gun in one hand and holding a flashlight on the other, you can't press A to turn it off. You have to press the gamepad down, open your virtual jacket and then unequip from there. HOW TEDIOUS CAN THIS GET??? Another example: you're standing next to an object your wish to pick-up, an ""pick-up object icon"" appears telling you to press A. To pick up an object, press A. The problem with this is that turning off the flashlight you need to press A as well. So if you're holding a flashlight and you need to turn off it off (it has limited battery life by the way), you'll have to move away from the pickable object so you can turn off the flashlight.
Here's another example again: You have a zombie attacking you, controls say you have to double click the left analog stick to do a quick turn. If you're holding a gun or a melee weapon, quick turn won't work, but then sometimes it does!!!
And here's another example: Driving a car is like driving a bar of soap on a smooth glass. A slight turn on the stick will spin your car uncontrollably. There's an action sequence in this game that requires some driving. I will warn you now, prepare to do this about 200 to 500 times because you will fail.

BUGGY ACTION SEQUENCE: There's an action sequence on Episode 2 where you have to escape an earthquake. The entire driving sequence requires you to get away from the earthquake before ti swallows your car. Unfortunately, the car is just completely unresponsive. Second, there's a jump that you have to make before the entire road cracks open. Sometimes you'll make the jump sometimes you won't. What's weird is that once your car flies over the cracked road, the game will turn into a full motion video showing your car making the jump. But once your car lands, somehow the game randomly decides whether the earthquake catches the tail end of your car thus killing you instantly or by some algorithmic calculation, you do make it. But that's just half of the problem because this action sequence will continue for the next 10 minutes and if you fail halfway or even on the last part of this sequence, the game will throw you back to beginning of the sequence. TOTALLY UNFORGIVING CHECKPOINTS. By the way, you can't skip the full motion videos which means you'll be forced to watch cheesy FMVs over and over again everytime you fail an action sequence.

How about weapons you ask? Forget about using guns. Guns are completely ineffective against zombies (which you will be battling the entire game). So if ever you decide to collect ammo, well...it's pretty much useless and waste of space. Zombies can only be killed by fire. If you do have to use your gun to kill zombies, you'll have to find gasoline or any flammable liquid, combine it with your bullets, load your gun with said ""gasoline dipped"" bullets and then shoot the zombies. But wait, you can't just shoot them anywhere. Zombies have this glowing yellow areas of their body that's vulnerable to fire. So on top of mixing and matching items to make fire, you'll have to be a sharpshooter to hit the zombies where it hurts. Otherwise, you'll just be wasting time and ammo.

I think I've said enough. This game is the worst ever for 2008. Do not waste your money on this.

However the response to what you do is very good.  It reacts almost instantly to what you do and it almost always does it the way you intended.  Also, it almost never swings when you did not intend to -- and when you swing it almost always swings too.  Plus the kind of stroke you use is represented accurately. For example when you use a forehand it does a forehand etc.  In this game you can play singles but the responsiveness of the racket is poor in comparison to the responsiveness of the Wii Sport Tennis game.  For example, most of the time it represents a backhand accurately, but occasionally it doesn't -- this happens much more frequently than it does in Wii Sport tennis.  It seems to have more trouble with forehands.  Sometimes I swing and it doesn't swing -- this occurs much more frequently than it does in Wii Sport Tennis.  Sometimes I don't swing and it swings -- again, this occurs much more frequently than in Wii Sport Tennis.  Plus in Wii Sport tennis the response to what you do is almost instant.  In this game you often see it respond somewhat after you do your stroke and in a way that the programming of the character switches around after you do it.  They need to improve the programming on this game  a lot.  I hope future versions are better than this one.  Some of the reviews said they spent long hours getting used to this before they liked it.  You can get used to lots of poorly done things if you spend long hours using them -- but that doesn't make up for the fact that it was poorly done in the first place.  It is true though that if you play the net you can do better and win more.

I don't think this is a problem with the Wii Motion plus.  In the Wii Sport Resort there is a table tennis game that in many ways is similar to tennis in that the strokes are the same etc.  All of the games in the Wii Rport Resort use the Motion Plus.  The responsiveness to the strokes is instant and extremely accurate in comparison to the responsiveness of the strokes in EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis.

1.0,False,"11 7, 2010",AAQS3N9XPXHWW,B002I0J6DC,J. Lethal,"First, as a gamer who played the original Castlevania on the NES and has generally enjoyed every 2D incarnation, I can tell you this in no way feels like Castlevania at all.  It's simply a gothic God of War with aggravating platforming and puzzles that aren't really puzzles at all.

The graphics in this game are a mixed bag.  They look decent, but the framerate is so choppy it reminded me of GTA3.  There's no slowdown, but all the movement just looks unnatural.  The sound effects are nothing special at all, and one of the bosses kept spamming the same taunt so many times I wanted to throw my controller right through the TV.

The combat is a straight GOW clone, with points having to be earned to level up your weapon so you can attempt to use combo attacks.  Too bad all but the simplest of enemies block repeatedly so it's nearly impossible to ever land one.  Mind you, I beat Ninja Gaiden Sigma, so I have no issues with games that feature complex combat and a high level of difficulty.  Also on the GOW ripoff front, one of your weapons is a gauntlet.  One stage even has ruins that look like Greece.  When I wasn't gritting my teeth over my endlessly blocked attacks, I was constantly moving to get the enemies back on screen since the camera is terrible.  As if this game isn't derivative enough, some of the bosses are actually called Titans.  They didn't even attempt to be original.  The start to one of those battles involved just running around at a distance like an idiot for a full minute before you can finally do anything.  I can't convey enough how stupid the boss battles are in this game.  When you're not climbing up some gigantic creature, you're running from whatever imps are there to annoy you so you can't hit a boss more than once or twice without taking damage.  Wouldn't want to actually be able to use any of those combos you spent points on, would you?  Striking an enemy does NOT keep it from attacking, so unless it has just missed an attack and has its back to you, you'll never land more than two hits without taking damage.

I also found myself cursing over not being able to advance.  This wasn't because the puzzles are too hard, but because they are nearly invisible within the game environment.  I spent lots of time scratching my head and attempting to make a jump when the whole time there was a ledge or something to hook my chain to that I just didn't see.  Objects that you're supposed to interact with glow, but not always.  At one point I had to remove the handle from one wheel to use on another.  The problem?  The wheel blended right in with the wall in the room it was in and did not glow.  After 20 minutes of circling through the entire level repeatedly, I resorted to a walkthrough and was furious to find out the solution, one I NEVER would have spotted and required no thought to ""solve"".

Then there are the platforming elements, which are entirely unnecessary as they add nothing to the gameplay and don't work well at all.  When holding onto a ledge, half the time pushing the analog stick does not send Gabriel in the right direction.  Several times instead of moving along the ledge, he just let go and fell.  Far too often I was never sure what direction he would jump, which again led to falling and trying again.  It's like somebody just said ""Hey, Uncharted is popular and involves jumping along ledges, let's throw some of that in here.""  In one case there was an area where I was completely stuck on where to go.  Turns out there was one exact point I had to jump from to land on the next platform, which was off camera.  Wow, just wow.

I've been a gamer all my life and never shy away from a challenge, but this game is overtly awful in every possible way.  I actually got angry enough to shout ""I hate this game!"" several times in a manner similar to those Gamefly commercials.  I changed the difficulty all the way down to easy just to make it go by faster, and even then it was torture.  To finish off an early boss, I had to go around the room smashing statues.  Are you kidding me?!  It had nothing to do with anything, and was another random thing I needed a walkthrough to figure out.  It has been a long time since I've played anything this terrible.  Don't even waste the money to rent this garbage, let alone buy it.  I know there are lots of good reviews, but I'm warning you, just don't do it.

From my research online I guess this is a major issue with many people. I even had trouble with the installation itself (the now famous redundancy error).  I cannot accept that they released a game that doesn't even install correctly.

Second the game itself.  It is an incredible step backwards from Sims 2.  We lose the load screens which indeed sucked, but we lose SO much more. The Sims very animation is poor, they always look a bit fat and their heads are too big (actually their faces are too big, their heads are ok). Those faces on the cover were generated on Photoshop, and no way they were a result from the game.

The jobs and needs were actually improved, but they are implemented on a game that lacks all that which made the previous ones great. The Sims seem more stupid and reluctant to follow directions. The number of objects is really small and the expressions and body language are the same from Sims 2 but the difference in color and animation only serves to remind you of what you aren't playing.  The greater loses are with the female Sims they never look feminine at all. It is very strange.
That and some crashes made me place the game back on the shelf.  In a couple of months I'm sure there will be a patch (or more...) that will reduce the crashes and the number of objects will larger with downloads.

the combat is simplistic and it holds your hand the whole way, in case you've never played a video game before in your life the game pauses itself and indicated when to block, ALWAYS, at first i thought it was tutorial, but no, right up until i stopped playing the game would give me a nice litle indicator screen to block with, if you fail the block however you just get knocked down... thats all... i can't imagine who thought it was a good idea to have the combat on the level of playing with duplo blocks.

the animation i can udnerstand, and it works well for the game, the overall feal of the game is suposed to be magical so the fudging and cel shaded style of it all comes off rather nicley except elika being damn barefoot all the time did piss me off though i'm not sure why.

(UPDATE) Eight months later another battery pack has failed.  I just contacted the company to see if they will replace this faulty device too.  Not a good track record for something with so many five star reviews.

(UPDATE) Called the company about the new failure.  They told me not to worry about sending the failed battery pack back and they just sent me TWO battery packs!  Since they didn't require the defective unit back, that gave me the opportunity to do some experimenting.  I took it apart and learned that it is simply packed with two AAA Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries.

That's when I found out that Blizzard had invented a brand-new feature for single-player games: massive, crippling lag. It's a surprising bonus, since you've just spent the last 30 minutes installing untold gigabytes of data onto your computer. Yet somehow, the thing needs to constantly pull data from the Internet - even though there's no one in dungeon but you.

You click, you wait, you die - often with no idea why.

But let's assume for a minute that Blizzard figures out its servers eventually and the lag returns to a semi-acceptable level where the game is playable. Then you find out about the errors. Tons of them. Errors that could have been fixed during this game's literal decade of development. Yes, you read that correctly, it took more than a decade to create this garbage. Yet you'll find constant errors that kick you out of the game, reset your character and shut off your game permanently. Yes, it sounds like it's made-up, but it's not.

For instance, I was lucky enough to encounter an error 316704 (party error) which kicked me out of the game and wouldn't allow me to return. The confusing part was, I wasn't in a party. I was playing a single-player game.

Blizzard managed to spend 11 years developing a game that doesn't run properly, and isn't very fun - even when it's not shutting itself down. The fact is, most of these problems could have easily been fixed by not requiring an Internet connection to play an offline game. But that would have been too obvious.

Better to be clever and release a game that no one can ever hope to play without losing all their progress to a random blip in cyberspace.

When Diablo 3 does run, it's mildly amusing, sort of like Torchlight except worse. So if you like that, then you'll like this in a few months when the glitches have been dealt with. But I don't have the time to waste waiting for my character to catch up to my mouse pointer so I can die by the hand of invisible monsters.

For the past year, I have stood by Final Fantasy VII saying that it is the best RPG ever created. I was wrong. It WAS the best RPG ever created in 1997. When FF VII first came out on the PSX it was said to be the best game ever put on the PSX. They were right. When it was released in '97 the graphics in the game blew away the graphics of previous games and later games. The storyline itself was gripping and although it had it's dull moments, it culminated in a spectacular finish.
Now I think the reason that most of you think this game sucks is because it has been 7 years, 7 YEARS!! since this game hit the shelves and every year we see new games and flashier graphics. And you DARE compare this game to a PS2 GAME!!!! It's just not fair. The capabilities of the PSX could never, in a million years, rival that of the PS2's capabilities. It's just not gonna happen.

Issues with game:

In short: it feels like 8 bit movement but looks like a modern graphical game.
~ Control scheme is proprietary, Instead of using a well known method moving your character around in game.- targeting, fighting, crouching, cover, leaning etc.  of most FPS games like COD, GTAV, HALO, Even DUKE NUKEM did a better controller feel. - and others that have game mechanics that actually work. - It feels very awkward controlling your character. This leads to much over aiming and re-compensation making what should be an excellent FPS game fall short of the name it was bestowed with. Developers goal must have been to make the feel of moving your character around like using WASD without a mouse. I won't be finishing it, I find it overly frustrating though trying to navigate the games mangled controller interface.
Anyone who prefers the responsiveness of the old nickel arcades playing q-bert or tron will love this game. - Anyone who prefers more fluid controller dynamics like COD, GTAV, HALO- even Mario Bros for Nintendo felt better.

~ Graphics are ok. Personally I think they don't look as good as metro, but they are alright. I wasn't expecting much just hoping for a good fun FPS. I feel let down. At least the game doesn't crash or freeze. .

However if there is a fanclub or Facebook group dedicated to lovers of hitting the square button, then this is definitely your cup of tea. Gamespot describe it as "" solid action and over-the-top gore"" and "" a cut above other movie tie-ins"", which translates to ;

Press the attack button until your thumb is sore, cut a mans arm off, cut his head off, impale a man on spike then cut another mans arm off and impale his mate on some spikes, then cut a different blokes head off and cut his mates arm off, then impale his mate on some different spikes, then decapitate a man and look for his mate so you can decapitate, cut his arm off, impale him on some spikes or some other fancy method of button mashing in sequence which boils down to you could of just killed him by pressing square! And all this has happened in the first 3 seconds of the game.

Oh yeh, to be fair I did leave out the JUMP button. After you have used the JUMP button and ascended to the next part of the game you get to cut a mans arm off, cut his head off, impale a man on spike then cut another mans arm off and impale his mate on some spikes, then cut a different blokes head off and cut his mates arm off, then impale his mate on some different spikes, then decapitate a man and look for his mate so you can decapitate, cut his arm off and impale him on some spikes.

Why do I save done waste your money on a Wiiu? Because every game on it you can play elsewhere. Games like new super mario is the exact same new super mario games on the ds, 3ds and wii. Games like mass effect 3 are the same thing as you probablly already played on other systems. Games like zombieu which being exclusive to wiiu is just another zombie shooting game. I played a few other games at a friends house and those were all very much ""been there, done that"". Granted it is a new system and good games take awhile to trickle out but at this point there are no must have titles. Third party support is also lacking as there aren't many third party developers creating a lot of new content exclusive to the wii u and the majority who are seem to just be porting other games to it.

I don't like the online aspects of it. Like the friend request process, the lack of universal game invites, and downloadable games being split between the eShop and Wii Channel. It is just all very user unfriendly compared to say the ps3 or a pc's online community. It still feels like nintendo is being dragged kicking and screaming into the online world.

It lacks the appeal to older people and non gamers that the wii did. Couple that with the fact the Ps4 was announced it looking rather nice so far and the fact that Microsoft should be announcing their next system soon, Valve is making a steambox and tablets/phones becoming more powerful it is hard to justify buying a wiiu.

I cant justify the price for what it is. A upgraded wii. There isn't a major technological leap here. Some might argue the tablet controller is a huge upgrade but its just a normal controller with a touch screen on it that has far less resolution than most smart phones, a less responsive touch screen and less features. The system itself is in HD now but it still lags behind the much cheaper and much older ps3 and 360 in terms of horsepower. But at it's core it is still just a wii.

The wiiu itself is essentially just a slightly upgraded wii and nothing more. I really didn't like holding onto that tablet for very long and since it served me no real purpose aside from a few gimmick features it was pointless to hold on it. I cant imagine playing games on it that require analog stick, it would be like holding a giant ps3 controller. It is a cool concept but no one has implimented anything into their games that makes it worth while. I also didn't care for how the controller is, it feels like its a couple generations behind the curve in its mens and interface.

For graphics people its still behind what a ps3 and 360 can deliver in terms of speed and graphics quality. You can buy a ps3 and a library of games for less than the cost of a wiiu system by itself and with the ps4 launching this year I cant even begin to reccomend buying a wiiu. Now good graphics do not equal good game, they never have but if they are important to you then you'll be dissapointed.

So my suggestion is if you own a wii then don't buy a wiiu. If you don't own a wii then buy one instead of a wiiu because you can buy a wii and a bunch of really great used wii games and still spend less than you did just buying a wiiu system with no games. The wiiu isn't worth the price right now due to lack of good games, maybe in a year when more have come out and so on but as of now its just lacking too much to be worth paying for a new system plus the cost of games.",Dont waste your money just yet.

It's just another hack n slash, but, the worst thing about it is there is no improvement on equipment. Weapons, Armor, Runes, magical items, shields, etc. all remain the same as in the origional. That +15% weapon you got in Prophecies is still as good as the +15% weapon you get in Nightfall and/or Factions. Without player/character improvements this series is destine for boredom much faster with each rendition.

  Once you have leveled up at least one character to level 20 the repitition is tedious and boring to say the least since it requires going thru the same content over and over and just hacking and slashing your way thru it. It's an experience grind, but, there's no other reason to level up since there isn't any improved equipment to be had.

  I grew bored playing Faction and were it not for the Alliance battles and the fort battles I would have quit playing the series a long time ago. Adding Heroes to the game does nothing for me except add more ignorant Ai performance during battles although it does allow me to keep them in place while I pull....about the only improvement worth Nightfall purchase.

  Bottom Line if you have the others and only if you play the non-pvp portion of the game will you really get anything of value out of this expansion. My suggestion is just wait until the price falls as it already has by $10 I see. It's just not the mmorpg that it should be. If they would separate pvp from non-pvp and allow players to progress in higher levels and equipment this by far would be an outstanding non pay to play game.

  First off, let me start with the campaign. You play as several characters. During the single-player campaign, the player controls five different characters from a first-person perspective. For the majority of the game, the player assumes the role of Sergeant Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson, a member of an elite, multi-national commando unit known as Task Force 141. However, the player begins the game through the eyes of Private First Class Joseph Allen, a Ranger stationed in Afghanistan, who later goes undercover in Russia for the CIA under the alias of ""Alexei Borodin."" Private James Ramirez, a member of 1st Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment stationed in the United States, serves as the player character during the defense of the United States eastern coast against a Russian invasion. John ""Soap"" MacTavish returns as a non-playable character for most of the game, but once again becomes the player character in the final three missions. In the five years since Call of Duty 4 took place, he has been promoted to the rank of captain in the Special Air Service. He now commands most of Task Force 141 and its field operations, acting as the superior officer of Sanderson. The player also briefly assumes the role of an unnamed International Space Station astronaut during an EVA in the minute or so prior to the station's destruction.

  The campaign is fun and takes you to many parts of the world, and there is a special game mode called ""Spec Ops"" in which you have a certain objective you must complete. These both have little replay value and therefore I'm basing my opinion of the game on the multiplayer aspect.

  Where do I even start with the multiplayer? First off, you have to link your multiplayer account to something called Steam, which is a gaming website/program. This means if you plan to re-sell the game, think again because this makes it close to impossible. Next, there's no dedicated servers. That's right. That means that whichever player hosts the game will usually have the advantage because he has the best connection. It is very difficult to connect to multiplayer online and when you do, you'll be lucky to get an entire match in. Hackers released a patch for the game which allowed dedicated servers but Infinity Ward quickly dealt with them. Another major flaw is no mods. Call of Duty 4 for PC allowed you to use mods which made the game more fun and addictive but for whatever reason Infinity Ward took them out.

  Ok so now that I've talked about the connection issues, let's get to the actual gameplay. It is very similar to the previous Call of Duty, except with improved graphics and some new guns. The new perks and weapon attachments can be really cheap and give players a far superiority over you, same thing with the weapons. This can make the game extremely frustrating. Also, the new selectable killstreaks can be annoying sometimes. Other than that, leveling up and prestiging can become old, repetitive, and boring.

  So my final words of advice to you: stay away from this game. Save yourself some money, time, and frustration.","Really, Infinity Ward?",1275782400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

All this game accomplished was to show us that the crystal dynamics engine can be pretty. It was a $60 tech demo. The story is quite good - however, the absolutely stale and aggravating game progression, disheartening battle system which relies entirely upon rapid paradigm shifts and undeserved trust in your AI partners, miserable voice acting (excluding lightning, snow, and hope) and overall offensive packaging of this ""game"", will leave you gnashing your teeth and forsaking the entirety of Japan.

The battle system is atrocious. The only times it truly shines are in boss fights, and more often than not, you are too busy trying not to get utterly destroyed to appreciate how well it actually does work in those rare occasions.

The summons are entirely pointless and were only put in the game arbitrarily, because most FF games have summons - Eidolons have been in the game before. You can only use one eidolon in a battle, and probably only once. Only the party leader can use their eidolon. Eidolons really don't do much damage, either.

There are no towns. There's one big town, aka planet like Coruscant, but even within that town you don't ever experience a traditional RPG experience where you go in Inns and shoppes and whatnot. You do all your shopping through computer terminals.

The upgrades are a very poorly explained system and frankly, just annoying. The characters are all JRPG cookie cutter archetypes, with bad costumes tossed on them - one of them completely bleeding with racial stereotypes.

By the end of the game, if you suffer long enough to make it to Orphan's Cradle, you'll hate it. You'll fight only massive groups of enemies, each of which can easily kill your entire party on its own. Assuming you care enough to make it through the last chapter, you'll get a disappointing ending.

Well, they got that part right, but not much else.  The game basically consists of you entering a level at one point, randomly digging all over the entire map, then searching for the exit.  There is no online multi-player as the 'Wi-Fi' logo on the box might lead you to believe, only local ad-hoc (that is, once you dig up the randomly placed cube needed to unlock that function).  You also have to locate other hidden cubes to unlock such basic features as say, using the cards that are included in the box.  Who thought up this genius idea?  This is a kid's game!  Another stinging point is no direct control over the Spectrobes themselves, just your main character who dies almost instantly any time he recives damage in a battle.  You can only use the L & R buttons to activate Spectrobes' attacks, while trying to position your player without dying.

1.0,True,"11 22, 2014",AXGPU830TXJ86,B00JUI8HJ4,Bitofinger,"So, to start off with a comparison, Dragon Age: Origins was one of the better games I have ever played; not so much for polished graphics or even exceptional game-play, but for the acting, witty dialogue, and compelling storyline.  The voices were extremely well done, and true-to-life believable.

Morrigan oozed potent sensuality with every word, but could turn on a dime with biting sarcasm.  Alistair's combination of loyalty, humor, and innocence were perfectly portrayed in his character's tone and timing.  Sten came off exceptionally well as the seemingly emotionless giant who was both teased to embarrassment by Leliana's coy playfulness, and secretly driven mad with desire by Morrigan's enthralling beauty.  Zevran was by far the quickest and easiest lay in the game, and his Hispanic accent and lover boy charm were in no way overacted.  Shale [spoiler alert] screamed ""flaming homosexual"" with every nuance of speech and every fretful concern over fashion, until you found out he was a she.

It seemed as if every character was portrayed with Oscar-potential acting.  The dialogue was witty even while being a bit juvenile; it had a sharp comedic edge, yet often a surprising sensibility.

Now for the horror that is Dragon Age: Inquisition.

Whenever I see an entertainment industry product so poorly done, I cannot help but ask myself, WHAT WERE THESE PEOPLE THINKING?

This is - BY FAR AND AWAY - the most artistically repulsive work of software fiction I've ever witnessed.  As other reviewers have noted, the shimmering, plasticine hair will drive you to absolute distraction, and make you want to pull out your own hair so you don't have to ever look at hair again.  HAIR, HAIR, HAIR!

Try to imagine - if you dare - melting a giant ball of plastic, placing the disgusting goop on top of someone's head so that it molds perfectly into a hair-like structure, and then, once it hardens to an immoveable, globulous mass, polishing the already bright helmet to the point that it outshines ALL other objects in the game, and that even the slightest movement bombards your eyes with a multitude of light flashes from the top of every character's head - EVEN THE BALD ONES!

I'm not sure how much worse it could get, but here's the ironic part: in some of the cut scenes, the hair is normal.  That tells me the shiny shine-shine is a disturbing attempt at some sort of extreme artistic device, but in truth it comes off as being derived from the never-ending war against consumer attention deficit.

Anyway, the rest of the game is equally atrocious in combat and looting mechanics, NPC interactions, story lines, dialogue, and, worst of all, voice acting.  These can all be summed up in two words: patently awful.  Not to mention that Inquisition is ABSOLUTELY an unfinished product, loaded with glitches.

I will add that you should take game's epilepsy warning seriously.  The game-play is so clunky (as other reviewers have said) and jerky that after playing about 8 hours over the course of 3 days, my vision seemed to be adversely affected.  I don't believe this is a frame rate issue, as I have a reasonably fast computer, and I tried all levels of graphic settings, to no avail.

It really never crossed my mind that the developers could $%^& things up THIS BAD.  What a fantastic disappointment.

Here are a few more examples of how this game is an abomination in every way.

Loading freeze:
So you start the game and get to the main menu.  You click on the top selection, ""Continue"", and nothing happens.  You click again.  You hit escape.  You close the annoying Origin DRM window.  You click the big red X (if in Windows platform, and in windowed mode). Doesn't matter - you're frozen.  This happens maybe once every five or six loads.  Task Manager is your only option.  By the way, you CANNOT play Inquisition without Origin up and running.  Yet another irritation, as if this game needed more.

Combat:
So you're getting slaughtered early in a battle, but you can't figure out why.  Three members of your party are all but dead, while a fourth remains healthy as a horse.  Well, that's because he or she got stuck a couple hundred yards away on a piece of rock about 1/8-inch tall.  Oops.

Looting:
So you go to pick up some loot.  You're a few feet away?  Okay, go walk over to it.  Still not close enough?  Stand on top of it.  Still can't pick it up?  Oh wait, that's because you're not FACING the loot.  Silly me, I didn't know my brain-dead character was spatially challenged.  Very much UNLIKE Origins, where, if you could click on it, your character would have the sense to WALK over to it, even from relatively far away, and turn THEMSELVES in the proper direction.  Imagine that. Dragon Age II made looting even easier, with an ultra fast keyboard shortcut.  Congratulations, BioWare; you've reversed almost 6 years of RPG progress, not to mention two major iterations of your own product.

Artwork:
So about 90% of the graphic design - everything from walls to grass to rock to skin to clothing - has almost as much shimmer as the disastrous hair.  At first glance, it looks as though the entire kingdom endured a recent hurricane, and everything is still wet.  I heard a calumnious rumor that the game's illustrators were orangutans hired at 5 bananas per day.  I can neither confirm nor deny its veracity.

Climbing and jumping:
So you're walking along, and there's a small hill you need to climb.  It's tiny, not even as high as your ankle.  But your character stubbornly refuses to move forward.  So you jump.  And.............................. that's it.  You hover in mid air with your knees up to your chest. Permanently.  You can look at the world around you (ooh, more shininess!!!).  You can switch characters.  You can look at your inventory, your map, your journal, etc.  Doesn't matter - the jumper stays jumped.  Hope you saved recently.

Ambient Dialogue:
So you're tooling along, minding your own business, when you hear prepubescent sparring between party members.

Iron Bull: ""Hey, that was some nice work back there, with that shield bashing.""

Cassandra: ""And you as well.""

Iron Bull: ""Are you as turned on as I am right now?""

Cassandra: ""Huh?""

Iron Bull: ""That's probably impossible anyway.""

Okay, so we're all back in 6th grade, and little Tommy gets really excited when the bigger boys make lewd comments about ""it"".  He doesn't understand these things yet, but they make him all hot and bothered.

The background music is some weird techno, and the voice-acting is loud and annoying -- It's seizure inducing. I wouldn't be surprised if this game causes blindness. This is the first fighting game I've ever played but I think you're supposed to SEE what's happening to your character and not have your ears destroyed by techno and bad voice acting.

Now there's another thing I want to talk about : No one cares about Deadpool anymore. Shuma Gorath is [----]. Is Captain America portrayed by Bucky or Rogers in this game? Guess we'll never know. Idiotic Capcom. Jean Grey has been dead forever. She-hulk?

How could they possibly leave out : The Sentry, Fantomex (Morrison is God), The Hood (Dormammu was his peon for years), Hope (Second Coming?), Bastion (Over the Sentinel), Moon Knight, Magik (My favorite X Character), Daredevil (Best Character Ever?), Osbourn (Iron Patriot? H.A.M.M.E.R?) The entire Fantastic Four, The Punisher, Ronald McDonald and lastly, Cyclops.

They've got Taskmaster, but no Cyclops. Cyclops, apparently, isn't important. He's ONLY the leader of Mutantkind. 'Kay, so we have X-23. X-23. X-23, a character that has been rammed down our throats for the last few years or so. X-23 but no Cyclops. X-23 over Cyclops? Really?!? Really, Capcom? Really?! This roster is a joke. AND IT'S ONLY FITTING... It's only fitting that Marvel would even be involved in all of this, because they've been getting completely destroyed by Morrison, Winick and Johns. HAHAHA.

1.0,True,"11 3, 2014",A1KPVSXSMO0JKU,B005FMLXW2,David T,"I needed a Bluetooth headset for use with my phone, and I thought that getting a headset that was compatible with my Xbox would make things convenient.  My brother owns this same headset and he likes it, but mine was no good at all.

--USE WITH XBOX--
It seems that a common problem with these wireless headsets when used with Xbox is a high-pitched noise experienced by other users when the wireless headset is muted.  Another problem is that you practically have to shout into the microphone in order to be heard.  When I tested this product on Xbox Live, I was informed that my voice sounded faint or distant, even though I had the microphone within a half-inch of my lips.
I had a difficult time when switching between Xbox and phone use, as the headset would not connect very quickly to either, and would not allow people to hear me.  The high-pitched noise experienced by others was also present, but only on the Xbox side.

--USE OVER BLUETOOTH--
The Bluetooth range on this headset is terrible.  It seems that even the thinnest of materials interrupts the signal between the headset and the connected device.  When the headset was in my ear and my phone was in my front pocket, the signal would become intermittent.  I couldn't hear the person that I was on the phone with, and they couldn't hear me.  In order to keep the connection strong, I would have to hold my phone chest-level, which defeats the purpose of a headset.

--COMFORT--
The headset is not designed to fit into your ear canal, but is instead designed to fit into the opening of your ear.  I found that the headset was prone to falling out of my ear.  The rubber that went around the speaker irritated my ear beyond belief and I would have to reach up and scratch the inside of my ear.  The loop that fits around the outside of the ear was a little big for me and didn't hold on tightly enough for my taste.

--OVERALL--
I cannot recommend this product at all.  It's uncomfortable, has spotty connectivity, and the microphone is awful.  The microphone has no noise cancelling and I received frequent complaints about wind noise, even when there was no wind to speak of.  The only good thing about this headset was the battery life (around 8 hours), which isn't even that great to begin with.

The Two Worlds 2 experience is not engaging, in fact so many times the game mechanics break any time of immersion I cannot imagine how anyone would consider themselves in the hero's role.

  The game starts off with an impressive cinematic that promises some interesting game environments, enjoyable combat, and an interesting experience overall.  Then when you start playing the game is so disappointing.  The environments are beautifully styled until you are out in them and realize it really isn't all that impressive to see grass and pixelated trees obscuring your view.  I love how your enemies whether beast or humanoid have ""weaknesses"" that you have no clue about unless you can decipher  the icons representing their strengths.  I've got a 50in HDMI and I can make no sense of what the game is trying to tell me.

  Once you actually get into combat your character prances around like a cheerleader twirling batons, or realizing you need to be within ten feet of an animal to use your bow, or use the endlessly repetitive spell combat. Your enemies either block, or practice incredible frustrating hit and run attacks.  These are not frustrating because they complicate combat, the enemies are typically incredibly weak but they feel the last moments of their life are better spent complicating you actions than fighting or fleeing.

  There are a few bright sides, like an interesting crafting mechanic and rich depth in defining your character.  Sadly when it comes down to it you are not unique, you are still the same cookie-cutter hero the game needs.

I was very much on the edge of my seat waiting for this game to be released.

Then came the announcement that Ubisoft was going to be using an activation based DRM implementation on the game.

After seeing how quickly other activation based DRM ""protected"" games were available in an unlocked form, I came to realize that so many other people were right:

This isn't about stopping piracy - it simply does not work. Publishers are shooting themselves in the foot by using these overly complex protection schemes to ensure a sale. The long term damage from angered customers just doesn't seem to get factored in to their business decisions.

Instead of fostering good will with their customers, they are forcing a ""first sale"" by creating an environment of FUD where a person buying a game off of eBay or Amazon Marketplace is worried about the install count remaining on a game. What nonsense.

Can you imagine buying a copy of this game from Amazon Marketplace and find out that there are no install counts left (remember: artificial limitation)?

The buyer gets a defunct copy of the game and has to fight with Ubisoft for another install count. It's not their fault, but they have to deal with it.

At the same time I was looking forward to this game, I knew that CD Projekt had been taking customer suggestions/complaints to heart and were working on a massive reworking of the dialog for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Witcher/dp/B000R2XJJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Witcher</a>.

This free patch was released in September of 2008 along with digital copies of the map, soundtrack, making of videos, game manual and game hints/tricks book. That shows me that they truly understand what fostering good will is all about.

I could have easily gone and purchased a used copy, but I instead decided to pre-order a retail copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Witcher-Enhanced-Edition/dp/B001AH8YSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Witcher Enhanced Edition</a>&nbsp;(no activation!) to show my appreciation for all of their hard work.

If you buy this game from Ubisoft, you are telling them that it is ""ok"" to limit resale. You are then setting a precedent for other publishers to do the same.

Does anyone remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bioshock/dp/B000MK694E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bioshock</a>? That game certainly is well known for multiple things, one is it's the first game that truly brought the activation requirement to the fore front. Since it went on to do great in sales and customers didn't really rally against it, the precedent has been set.

It's ""ok"" the customers said, ""we'll deal with it. We just want the game"".

Well guess what, the publishers heard you loud and clear and are happy to deliver the activation process as part of your gaming experience.

""So what!?"", you may say, ""I'll just buy the console version"" or ""Just buy a copy and then shelve it right before I grab an unlocked copy"".

You go ahead and do that, hand over your money to a company that is determined to strip resale rights away from their customers. The next thing you know you'll find that this practice migrates to consoles.

After all, there isn't much left that makes a console stand apart from a PC in terms of tech. Sure, a PC ""can"" use better hardware, but for a vast number of customers a current generation console is ""good enough"" for their graphical needs.

In summary, I'm rating this product as a dud:

Listen, I love ""extreme sports"" games, and I'm not the most difficult person in the world to please, but Infinite Air should be avoided at all costs. I even recommend bad games at a low cost if they have any redeeming qualities, but Infinite Air doesn't have a single redeeming quality. While I can often find something to enjoy with even the worst of games, this is one that I regret buying. This is the worst game I've bought in many, many years, and considering I paid $40 for it from Best Buy, I definitely feel like using that $40 to wipe my behind would've been a better use of it.

Now why is it so bad? Oy vey, where do I even begin? I mean, literally everything about this game is mediocre-terrible.

1. If you want a game with functioning controls, look elsewhere. While this game tried its damnedest to offer an overly complex and annoyingly difficult control scheme, it failed. The controls fail to work more often than not. Every trick is listed in the menu with its button configuration, but it often fails to register the correct trick, or even register one at all. I've also done tricks a number of times where the trick doesn't even register with its corresponding name on the screen, nor do the points that you should receive for doing said trick get added to your point total. Infinite Air was trying to be Skate for snowboarding games, but it failed at that. Skate's controls work, whereas Infinite Air's controls don't work as intended the majority of the time.

2. The game's framerate chugs along, completely ruining any fluidity the game might otherwise have if the controls weren't so horrendously awful. Whether you're in the helicopter or on your board, this game often feels like it's being played in slow motion.

When you have broken controls and broken framerate, what more could you possibly need to know to know that this game is absolutely NOT worth any amount of money.

Well, if you must know more, here are a couple more reasons you should avoid this game:

3. The presentation is as bland as possible. Cookie cutter, generic, bland, etc. There is nothing inspired about this game.

4. It constantly respawns you in terrible places. Was there a QA team for this game? If there was, were they strung out on illegal substances while testing it?

5. ""But it's a realistic simulation, Horowitz!"" If that was even remotely true, why did I just do a front flip and land it on flat powder? This game isn't even remotely realistic. It wants you to think that it's realistic so that you forgive its horrid controls and generic presentation, because ""hey, a simulation is supposed to be difficult and boring to look at!"" Just, no. Don't make excuses for this shoddy piece of software trying to masquerade as a simulation.

Anyways, I'm rambling at this point. I legitimately hate this game and curse those who made it.

The game's content is bare bone minimum with big signs ""lazy"" & ""Greed"" all over the place.  As one of the MOST FAMOUS ARCADE game in the video game history, it is such irony that it does NOT come with an Arcade Mode!!  Are you kidding me Capcom??

There is a ""Story Mode"" to replace the ""Arcade Mode"" which is a joke.  There are 16 select-able characters and each of them has a story mode.  Unfortunately, it is only made up of badly drawn cartoon with writing to tell with story, plus 2 to 3 story battles which is so easy to the point the gamer can just press the kick/punch bottons to win the battles.  No more full and well drawn animation like we had in any of the Street Fighter 4 games, which is clearly just lazy work from Capcom.

The ""Survivor mode"" is cheap - easy on the first half & the computer characters will start doing cheap move onces you pass half of the mode. You cannot save your progress (yes, it is survivor mode) and you will lose all your CP money.

It also come with a regular training mode nothing to write home about.  Unlike the PS3 games, you can't play the online mode unless you pay extra $50 for PSN Plus.

Capcom gone extremely cheap, all the extra characters, color, customs must be brought either the in-game money earned by beating each game mode; however, the amount of in-game money can be earned is so little and people want all the characters and costumes must pay ""Real Money"" otherwise it is almost to impossible to purchase all of them with in-game money.  Beating the game to unlock the extra is now a history in the past; Capcom wants you to pay extra money for the ""extra"" items.

The most important part is the battle system is a few step backward comparing to Street Fighters IV.  There are a lot less game options/tools for each character even after the consideration of the V-system.  Everything is so repetitive with so much focus on the foot sweep and vertical jump.

I've been a part of Gran Turismo from the very first one on PS1.
and I don't hate change and even welcome it at most times... But I do hate change when it was never needed to begin with.

Let me start this off by saying ""Gran Turismo Sport"" is pretty much a Online only game.
it may say ""Internet Required For Most Functionality"" on the front cover of the box, but that's pretty close to a out right lie.
The only thing you can do offline is ""arcade mode"" which would have been fine, BUT unless you have internet you can not Save your progress.
So~ whats the point in even playing it offline then?...

With Gran Turismo Sport near empty on the content we've gotten before and as well no offline mode to speak of, with also still a 60$ price tag... and they them self saying, they have no plans for a Gran Turismo 7.
Polyphony Digital has been on thin ice with me with how awful GT5 and 6 was... but now this is the last straw.
This was just awful to do to hard core fans as well as new comers...

They should have made a GT7 and then later release GTS.
That way all bases would have been covered and not make this confusing release
NO one should have to look up and ""research"" a game they already know and love, to see if it's still THAT.
GTS was a very misleading release and people should be well aware not EVERYONE keeps up with gaming stuff 24/7.

But none of this has to say about gameplay and the overall game. Gran Turismo Sport plays great and feels great,
with smooth tracks, beautiful cars to boot and clean menus to work with... It may only have 162 cars as of this moment, but more cars may be added in future (updates)... with also strong push of online racing and the E-sports world.

but again this another problem I have...
Polyphony Digital not only they take FOREVER to release their next game, but their also never ""Done"" even after so much time... With tons of ""updates"" on the way and as well have no future when the severs get shut down.
Gran Turismo Sport is nothing more then a Could of, Should of, Would of.
A game that will be forgotten after more Race games come out.

I may have high speed internet, but I have no illusions that EVERYONE has it and/or likes to be on it 24/7.
I like to play all my games offline.
I do not do ""DLC"", ""Redeem Codes"", ""Updates"" or ""Microtransactions""
if any of the four things are found in the game, Stars will be lost no matter how good the game is.

GTS gets 1 star for being a pointless installment to the GT games
*Online only
*Next to no content that past games have had
*Nearly out right lying on the front cover
*Great deal of bugs
*Asking 60$ for a half empty game
*No plans for a GT7, (but we get this)
*Tons of updates to a game that should be ""done"" by now
*You can't ""Save"" playing offline
*Removed many of the things that made GT great

I have bought the full version of every blizzard game ever made. I was one of the 1,000 beta testers of Diablo II. I bought the collectors version of world of warcraft and diablo 3. I WAS a fan-boy. I think the activision/blizzard merger and sloughing off of their original team has obliterated the spirit of this company.

#1 COMPLAINT -IMPOSSIBLE & CHEAP DIFFICULTY-
Diablo 3 has been a horrible disappointment for me. In hell mode, not even inferno mode, with max gear bought off the auction house, I die in 1 hit from normal mobs. I am a witch doctor. This game is supposed to be a hack and slash. Hack and slash should be somewhat laid back, even in harder difficulties, like Diablo II was. Granted it should have hard moments, but you shouldn't hit a brick wall every 2 minutes, that is if you can even get past the first brick wall. There are so many countless ways for mobs to kill you instantly. Instant death is around every corner. It makes the game a horribly painful experience. And the instant death is often quite cheap. For example a mob can pull you to them from across the screen and 1 hit you. A mob can die, and when they instantly explode on death which instantly kills you, which is especially horrible for melee classes. They can put up an impenetrable wall behind you, and a laser that rakes across you, killing you instantly. Some mobs run twice as fast as you and 1-hit you. You cannot esc quit. There are no counters to these things. It doesn't matter what your skill level is, you will die, and die, and die. In multiplayer games, players simply drop out when there are mobs like these. You will not be able to do a play-through of an act in later difficulty with the same players because death is so frequent people simply give up.

-HOPELESS HARDCORE MODE-
In hardcore mode you will be lucky to make it past nightmare difficulty. I wouldn't even consider making a hardcore mode character. In Diablo II I had a couple level 90+ hardcore's. That was the main reason I was looking forward to Diablo III, all the fun I had in tense boss fights hoping I wouldn't die with my hardcore character, but if I did starting over was still fun. With Diablo III, you die so much it's pointless to even try. It's not fun at all, just 100% guaranteed death and disappointment because you know your death will be based not on a miss-step, but on an undefeatable foe.

-CHINESE BOT-FARM AUCTION HALL-
Auto farming bots that farm gold 24/7 have already inflated auction hall prices into the millions of gold for a single item. A mob will drop around 100 gold in hell difficulty, and take maybe a minute to kill since it has to be kited so you don't get hit. So if you are a legit player, you are basically out of luck unless you are willing to pay American dollars for pretend gold from China. And blizzard gets a whopping 15% cut. Blizzard succeeded in somehow making the problem of Chinese gold farmers even worse than it already was, and also succeeded in coming off as just another sleezy game company that doesn't care about game balancing or the spirit of fair competition.

-CONCLUSION-
This is not the laid back and enjoyable hack and slash that hardcore-hell-mode diablo II was, this is a real life nightmare that you can only wake up from by not playing the game.

This game is absolutely nothing like what has been advertised and shown in trailers for the last year, not even close. First thing you'll notice.....it's just a doom 3 mod, yes, it is......all the way, a 6 year old doom 3 mod.....a step back in time in terms of visuals and gameplay to the point you will ask yourself ""really?"" and feel insulted because all of those fabulous trailers with all that ambient occlusion and dynamic lighting and sexy visuals....yea.....that was just a fluff to preserve preorders....this game has none of them, none. Amazon should really consider pulling the screenshots on this product page as they are completely misrepresentative of the product actually being purchased, they are not real, fake, they are photoshopped bulls*** and do not represent the game you will be getting. This entire fiasco has bait and switch written all over it.

I just couldn't stomach it, it is that bad and i consider myself a over the top aliens fanatic, this was a punch in the face and kick to the wallet and a lesson learned to never ever purchase another gearbox title in the future, I won't even get into the looming storyline plot holes and absolutely inept AI, you can actually complete entire rounds without firing one shot.

I suggest anyone who purchased here at amazon immediately request a refund under the guise of ""product not as described"", amazon will give you a refund as long as you don't make a habit of it with digital purchases, they are here to protect us from these types of products when the developer do this. It becomes painfully clear as to why gearbox has such a strict NDA policy on reviews, it's because they did not want everyone to cancel their preorder the second they saw actual game play or honest reviews, because anyone in their right mind would have and nobody knows that better than the developer. If it weren't for the aliens licensing this would be a $15 game if that, no joke.

I don't care how much of an aliens fan you are this game is absolute kick to the genitals and an insult.....this is what the gaming industry has become....they know they created a total turd but they still only wanted to pull the wool over our eyes as long as possible.

I am 35 years old and have been gaming since the commador 64 and intelivision and can honestly say I have never seen such a let down in all my gaming years, i will never purchase another gearbox title for as long as i live.

 Do yourselves a favor and check out some of the reviews before you even dream of purchasing this, amazon will not let us put links in reviews so i would suggest you google search ""angry joe"" for his review or ""videogamer.com"" and most importantly the meteacritic score and review, they all hit the nail right on the head and expand into just how bad of a bait and switch scam this really is.

1.0,False,"06 17, 2009",A378BKTN4BV0WA,B00166N6SA,Jason,"Well, if you are EA, apparently you strip out all of the items, interactions, and gameplay enhancements from this game, and create a game that gives you lots of half formed ideas of potential gameplay, that rarely follows through.

For starters, we get this open, ""seamless neighborhood"".  No more loading screens!  Great!  and admittedly, the first couple hours of gameplay were really very neat. Your sims can walk, jog, ride a bike, taxi or drive a car just about anywhere in town.  What's not to like?
Well, there are no entry/exit animations for any of the vehicles, your sim just fades out of existence, then is magically in the car.  They even do this for the bicycle...also, while there are no loading screens, travel is pretty time consuming.  So, it is pretty much break even time-wise.  Once you actually get where you are going, there really isn't a whole lot to do. You could collect bugs or seeds, harvest plants, or fish...oh, and also collect gems.  Now, is this the Sims 3, or some bad MMO?

And most of the community lots are ""rabbit holes"" since, who wants to actually be able to go inside a restaurant or store to socialize, people don't actually do that!  We get a couple of beaches, too, but all you can do is fish in the ocean.  i guess swimming, tanning, building sandcastles, etc will be released in another overpriced expansion pack.

CAS is another bone of contention.  While all the customization with the LIMITED hair is nice, making a sim that doesn't look like a porcelin doll from hell is too time consuming to be worth it.

I'll take this opportunity to point out a positive:  The traits are a great addition to the game.  I love being able to combine all sorts of traits to get some really whacked out sims.  And once in a while, they will do something autonomously that is quite amusing.

Interactions with other sims are frustrating at best.  Gone are the days where if your relationship score is high enough with another sim, you will be able to perform more advanced social options on the menu.  Options pop into and drop off of the list at random.  Your sim may have a wish to marry the girl next door, but good luck trying to romance her that far.  Too much is left to chance for a control freak like me.

It just feels like EA gathered a group of game designers that had never played the sims together, explained the concept of the game, and let them have at it.  The results are really lackluster, at best.  We can't even create our own neighborhoods, like we could in the BASE sims 2 game.  Sure, someone said in an interview once that there would be a tool released that would allow to create our own neighborhoods, but I'll believe that when I see it.  As of right now, if you want a superior experience playing a Sims game, you might as well just stick with the Sims or the Sims 2.

  they die in battle

  Cons:

  - The random nature of some of the characters.  One of them is a
  crocodile.  Why?

  - No squad system to make controlling your armies simple.  Instead, you
  have to do a square select to control multiple units.  And this becomes
  a pain when you have large armies.

  - If all party members die its game over, an RPG element that is really
  annoying in an RTS.

  - You command your army using the touch screen, but most maps are so
  huge that it takes forever to go and issue a command.

  - You have to go and select the spawn points in order to summon new
  monsters, and then you have to give them orders once they spawn.

  - At the start of each battle, you can only select 5 monsters to summon
  during the battle

  - Player AIs.  All of your AIs, including your own party, are pacifists
  that will stop attacking if you aren't spamming the attack order via
  the touch screen.  So if you have to go do something off screen, your
  units become completely useless.

  - The above flaws make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to go
  after the treasure chests without losing.

  - Enemy AIs don't suffer from the flaws that the player AIs do.",This game had a lot of potential but fails to deliver,1290816000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Beowulf has a hack n'slash gameplay similar to the Dynasty Warrior series. You lead a small group of Thane soldiers, while fighting creatures in the kingdom of, Herot. The game follows the movie it is based on somewhat loosely. There are creatures you kill and places to explore not seen in the movie. Fighting new creatures and going to new places in not all it is cracked up to be.

The biggest misgiving about Beowulf is its shoddy controls and bad camera system which fights against you through out the game. In certain levels Beowulf controls fine but other times he moves sluggishly and the button pressing on your controller are not always responsive; just adding to the frustration. As you play Beowulf, the ""mighty"" monster slayer, you will punch, throw, stab and smash enemies either with your barehands or with  shields and swords. Weapons are easy to find as you venture through the levels. Other times you can steal your enemy's weapon by pressing a button sequence on your controller.

And this brings me to another giant flaw within the game, the constant button mashing is tiresome and boring. Your soldiers help you fight off some of the enemies but they expect you to do most of the work. With button delay responses and constant pounding, your hands will ache really fast. There are also several sequences that force you to use the button rythm match game (press x, then y, then a etc...). If you are not good at those rythm type games, you will have a very tough time in this one. You will die a lot and realise that Beowulf is not mighty at all, but more of a wimp.

Pros:
+excellent music
+excellent sound effects
+bloody and brutal

Cons:
-last generation graphics
-cheap animations
-terrible controls
-terrible camera
-boring levels

After contacting the seller, Videgamesdiva, I was told that this was spec stock and that I should try to open it, if it broke, I would be issued a refund.

So, I got out a metal flat head screw driver, applied a sizable amount of prying force and was able to get the case open.

The main issue is the screen protector. First off, if the screen isn't in its locked position, the case WILL NOT CLOSE without damaging your psp, so it must be locked. When it's locked, it's jammed and can't be opened without some sort of metal prying tool.

After prying it open the first time, I decided to give the case a second chance, placed my psp inside, locked the screen protector in place and closed the case. Yet again, the case was jammed shut and I was unable to open it with my bare hands. I had to use a metal flat head screw driver to get my psp out safely.

I did a little research on Sony's forums, I found many others had the same issue with this item. I'm currently waiting on a reply from Videogamesdiva, and I'll follow up to their reply to better inform the rest of you as to whether you should do business with them.

Due to the tedium of having to repeat the same missions I set the game play to ""easy"" just so I could accomplish any forward movement through the game.

Worse is that if you die, the game throws you back at some random origination point on the map. This requires you drive/run/walk over huge stretches of territory just to get back to the point on the map where you last died in order to continue.

Another time I fought my way through a mission but needed to log out of my computer. I thought it would save my progress to that point so I could pick up where I left off. Nope, I had to play through the entire mission, including waiting through those agonizingly long cut scenes again.

The game punishes you for playing it; the tedium of repetition of missions and the extent one must go through to get back to where you were should you die, is a huge disincentive for me.

The other issue are the graphics; I cannot afford to buy the latest, fastest computer every time a new games comes out. I actually have a two year old ""gamer PC"" and Nvidia video card, yet I had to set the graphics on the lowest level or the game was too stuttering (laggy) to be playable.

2. You are not able to create additional characters. At least, I could not figure out how and I have been playing this franchise for years. I simply wanted to start a new game with a whole new character because I was getting my ass kicked even on the easiest level and I wanted to experiment with the myriad of character traits you can apply points toward.

3. The game is hard, even on the easiest level. I used only one hero to do all of the battles. I brought out other heroes to pick things up that I would leave behind, so I could use my movement points only on what I wanted to. Let me be clear. I used this one hero for all battles and for picking up any chests or other artifacts. Everything else, like random resources laying around, was picked up by a different hero. By the time I came into contact with an enemy player. I was level 12 and the enemy player was level 15, and was a deadly threat. This game is far, far too hard on the easy level.

4. You get points that you can apply to your character. There are a lot of traits that you can apply points to, but suffice it to say that there is a considerable learning curve. You really don't get a good understanding of how these traits affect your hero until you are already playing.

5. Read number 3 again.

One thing I really, really liked about the game was the new layout and navigation of the town screen and the way the game mechanics worked. Some people really don't like this, but I did. Also, I found the graphics to be nice and thought they were a good improvement.

Overall, I would not have purchased this game if I did not have the entire series. I never would have bought the game if I had been given a free trial opportunity. They game is simply not worth the time.","Absolutely not worth the price of admission, even at a severely discounted cost.",1411948800,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",
1.0,True,"02 23, 2017",A225FZ1LKFGZOP,B00ZQBLNP4,Damien,"No matter what kind of game you are making, be it a shooter, adventure, simulator, platformer, etc. the gameplay MUST work. A game can be difficult because of enemies or puzzles or the world itself but a player should not be struggling to do simple tasks. The Last Guardian is a game with long development cycle and a good amount of hype behind it. I was so hoping for this game to deliver and I am saddened to say it failed on every front.

I have been playing video games since I was 7 years old starting with Super Mario Bros on the NES and I have never felt the level of frustration in the one hour I played this game. Did I beat it? Absolutely not. I took this game out of my PS4 so fast that PS4 didn't have time to upload anything to the cloud. Gameplay is king no matter what kind of game you are playing. It is what separates games from other types of media and art. So if the gameplay does not work then the idea of a game does not work.

If I play a walking simulator, I expect to be able to walk without struggling with my controller. A shooter should shoot when I press the button. Mario should jump when I press the jump button. Everything in this game is done incorrectly. Why would you map out the buttons on the controller like you have not played an action adventure platformer in 25 years? In what world is triangle the jump button? The physics are out of whack, the AI is horrendous. I have a dog and I have had this dog since it was a pup. Never have I had to call her so many times to come over. I have met older dogs that weren't as unresponsive. I'm just going to watch someone on Youtube play this game and see the emotional trip everyone else is raving about.

I recently played Shadow of the Colossus and the controls and camera weren't the greatest but I wasn't constantly fighting them. If you notice the camera, gameplay, or the physics then the game is completely off. How can anyone forgive this game for terrible gameplay is beyond me? If I press X to let go and the boy does not let go then we have a problem. This is a world everything is against you: Trico, the obtuse world, the player controls, and the camera. Give me a break. How could they charge $60 dollars for this? This is probably worth $20 at the most. I won't paying anything for this. Have the developers been living under a rock or something? Have they not played Zelda, Rayman, Rachet & Clank, or even Uncharted? This is not a platformer. This is a train wreck. The only other game in recent memory that I felt this angry about was Thief. At least Thief's gameplay controls worked, it was just the world was completely lifeless.

Not sure who would enjoy this because I thought since I beat Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and having a dog was a good enough requirement to love this game. I was completely wrong. One positive to the game... I have nothing. Sorry. Play Inside or Rayman Legends or Shadow of the Colossus instead of this.

There are 16 SP foil cards which you'll get 1 at random included in the purchase of HHD. These SP foil cards unlock 3-4 exclusive items not unlocked in the game over time. For example Isabelle card unlocks a scooter, Isabelle's pic, and blossoming dress. These cards are scanned at the Amiibo phone in the main building which is unlocked about 15mins into game play, so not right away.

The other 84 character cards are of characters you can discover over time in the game and upon decorating their house you'll get their exclusive items added to your collection. So other than the SP foil cards which you'll only get 1 of, the rest let you get game content on demand and at a faster rate than you'd get by playing the game normally.

Another point to make is by using these cards and unlocking more of the game's collection you'll have more items to design with early on in the game directly impacting your designs.

There is no team play/community play, which is the only reason I play madden.  It's a way to keep in touch with my brothers who live far away while playing a game against other groups of people.  To me it seems absurd to remove online modes in a game released in 2014!  They're going backwards with this one.  So, it's not $60 for last years game with roster updates, it's $60 for last years game minus some features that are crucial to a significant number of Madden fans.  It's also further proof that EA makes enough money off this subpar piece of crap year after year to not give a damn what the fans want.  Too many people still buy it and this year I am guilty of that.  I'm sending this back, however.  Easily the most disappointing Madden EVER released.  EA should be ashamed to put their name on this waste of resources, but apparently they have no shame.  No wonder they didn't release a demo, they wouldn't want to tip off their loyal customers (perhaps loyal only because they have a monopoly on NFL games, which is bad for us gamers) that they are about to sell them a $60 coaster.

They take donations to gather sponsors, but it is free to sign and add your voice.  If they release a patch to put team play back in the game, I would reconsider my stance on this game and might add a star or two.  We need competition in this market in a bad way, then EA would have to listen.

In short, it is true that it is a $60 roster update (funny: EA roster updates cost more than a year of XBOX Live now?), but it is also missing the key feature that has made the last few editions of Madden so enjoyable for me.

The game play of the origninal was not that great for a PS3 generation game but the story in coop mode was simply great.  Breaking into jail, the night club scenes were epic.  Dog Days simply had no story.  The guns seemed better and the game play better, but from scene to scene, the story was incoherent and I lost interest.  When the game ends, me and my friend said ""what...that was it?""  The campaign was short, like real short.  My friend and I are experienced FPS players (but have a life outside of video games) and we beat the game on hard difficulity in about 4 hours, which is ridiculous.

Hit detection is poor for human players but excellent if not unreal for AI. I mean you die with two bullets. There is no scope on guns and no grenades; you throw canasters instead. After you heal your partner you automatically stand up and may get shot if not killed (there is no way to change this).

The multiplayer is entertaining.  Fragile alliance gets you paranoid that one of your fellow gamers are going to kill you for the money.

Story was awesome when it wasn't dragging the player down and asking them... wait i sorry i meant forcing them to look at objects in the game to ""examine"" it's beauty and attention to detail.  Yes i get the game is good looking, but i want to actually play a game here.  The game is 2/3 walking/examining objects/ quicktime events/story and 1/3 actual gameplay.

There wasn't a lot of opportunity for the player to explore the levels through different possibilities in the game (very linear).  Would not recommend at $59.99 price point nor a $40.00 price point, but only a $19.99 at the most for this game.  It's unfortunate because the game succeeds in graphics, story, and the very limited gameplay.  The idea/premise of the plot is awesome and very different from all other FPS on the market, just wish they actually put more effort especially since they delayed the game over a year ago therefore there should have been a larger focus on ""oh idk"" gameplay since its a video game!

Finally just a personally note, the developer was very apprehensive about notifying the consumer to the actual estimated campaign time, which i understand to a point. If you're gonna do what Ready and Dawn did as a publisher and dodge the question and get upset when the various forms of media outlets ask your how long players can expect to play, instead of just coming out and saying the estimated time something is shady.  Theres no reason to be upset, quite the opposite the consumer has the right to be upset that you're not telling them how long the campaign is even if its only 5-8 hrs long yet you still demand that your game is worth $60.00!

I won't support a developer that has to dodge around the customers questions about there product and give indirect answers in hope that the misinformed consumer will still purchase their product.

DRM has hurt this game more than any other game before it.  D3 was a blessing compared to SC2013.

Pros:

- The cities are half decent looking graphically

Cons:

- *Small complaint but stupid nonetheless* You are forced to play the tutorial even if you know how to play the game- this doesn't sound like a big issue (and its more of a nuisance) but early on in the game with the server issues it meant I had to play the tutorial 4 times before I could start a city... a tutorial I'd already played 100x during beta weekends... fail

- Cities won't load and there's no apparent fix - this was the simple inability to load my cities... period.  There was no other option, I could abandon them and come back a week later and re-claim and they would still not load.  It was not 1... or 2... or even 3 cities, it was many many cities.

- Game requires too much bandwidth - If you are downloading something or have family members streaming movies and such expect your cities to constantly have issues and need to be rolled back.

- Cities need to be constantly rolled back - even if it's not a bandwidth issue you'll find that EA want's you to constantly roll back your progress.

- No way to save your progress - expect EA to know exactly when to save... even though they wont.  Next time you kick on your game play the guessing game ""how many minutes will I have to replay""

- No way to roll back the game on your own - Can't roll-back your own city progress to undo something you've done by accident or to experiment and see ""what will this do""

- Way too much ""work"" - You'll learn to get sick of the bulldozer RRREAALLLL quick... people abandon buildings too fast and they constantly need to be destroyed. Oh and, patch 2.0 made it to where people will abandon places MORE often.

- The games finances do not seem to scale well - I haven't had to ability to test the numbers (due to cities not loading and a pure dis-interest in the game) but I found it amazing how hard it was to make $$$ with cities that had 350k people when there was very little difference in the cities infrastructure from when it was racking in the dough with 250k or 150k residents.

- Traffic is a joke - It's pretty funny how sims will spend the better part of 12 hours stuck at an intersection.... the game has no resemblance of how anything really works... I don't want to ""avoid 4 way intersections"" or ""make 1 long road that curves so you have no intersections""... are you kidding me?

- Traffic is a joke pt2 - 1 major highway into the city? gggreeaattttt.

- Cities are too small - You can read all about it elsewhere... It's true, there's no denying it.

- No terraforming

- Residents unhappy over stupid stuff - 350k people ""worried about crime""... check crime map... 3 crimes a day... ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Oh and, after patch 2.0 people will get upset MORE easily... greattttt.

Ehhh, thats enough for me.  There were a lot of bright points to the game but they get squelched by just about everything.

The only star this game gets goes directly to Amazon.com for allowing refunds to continue even today, weeks after the 30 day deadline... I waited until patch 2.0 to see if my cities would be useable because I simply had zero desire to create new ones. I'd already made 20 cities and there's not enough diversity in this game to justify getting myself back to where I was just to have the maps lost in an infinite limbo again. Yes a few of my maps load, but when big cities are so reliant on the ones around them to provide services and those maps simply won't load, every grouping ended up broken.

Unfortunately, the result of the collision is a horrid mess.  Square smashed this game out of the park graphically, and the sounds effects and music are decent too. Unfortunately as well, that's where the positives stop.

- The UI is awful and unintuitive.
- Play control is ruthlessly cumbersome.
- Players are (mostly) unhelpful to new players.
- Race/Class combination is pretty boring. Each race has a ""best"" class and most people go that route.
- Did I mention play control is horrible?

So hooray, Amazon finally has the product. As with all Razer products, very nicely boxed...too bad my N key was dead out of the box. I never got a chance to try the keyboard seriously first time around. Also I was immediately not impressed with the backlighting, it seems too dim on all the keys, but the Razer logo glows annoyingly bright on the bottom edge. If the keys could be half as bright it would be good.  Also the font they chose for the letters on the keyboard is too modern and simply hard to recognize. I have been using a Logitech Mac edition of the diNovo, and its feel is far superior feel to the Anansi. I am getting a replacement, and I will give it a good test.
 And fortunately, as always Amazon makes returning a breeze.

OK UPDATE...Feb. 2012
Gave it a good test. Kept at it, hoping it was a learning curve thing... nope. Unfortunately, little good to say. Now I really wanted to like this because I love the Naga mouse.

Now to be fair I have big hands and the Anansi was not easy to type on as a normal keyboard. Even though the unit is physically large, the keytops themselves are too small with larger than normal beveling. Feel for me could only be described as really lousy, for touch typing I kept hitting 2 keys at once.

The keyboard uses 2 USB ports because of the power needed for backlighting, and that is annoying when you have a lot of peripherals. I prefer using a separate power AC source, like Logitech gaming boards. The whole keyboard is very light, and does not have ""sticky"" large rubber feet big enough to prevent it from moving on my desk, especially when the rear feet are flipped up to provide a positive angle of attack. One of the 2 main reasons I wanted this keyboard was the set of dedicated modified keys on the bottom edge, giving a supposedly easier way of hitting modifiers with the Naga. The idea behind the design is to be able to hit these with your thumb while left hand fingers are on the WASD keys. I found that very difficult, if not impossible being the modifiers are close together and I was always hitting the top row key when reaching for the bottom row. These keys for some inexplicable reason are rubber-covered, so the side of your thumb will not slide but tend to catch even a small corner of the unintended modifier key.

Obviously, since this is a human interface device, my comments are from my point of view with my hands and personal dexterity. I would same someone with smaller hands would do better, but them there is the issue of the thumb reach to the modifiers, and a small hand would have to move off the WASD keys to get the further keys. Remember, this is gaming, so the right hand is going to be on the mouse. Meaning you have to be able to reach all the modifiers keys with your left thumb or it defeats the purpose.

On a positive note, it is attractive on the desk, and Razer does a ridiculously great job of embracing the customer with their packaging on all their products....unfortunately in the case of the Anansi I would encourage them to go back to the drawing board and deliver a keyboard worthy of accompanying the great Naga, because for me this just ain't it.",Not worthy to accompany the superb Naga,1319587200,8,{'Platform:': ' MAC'},

In comparison I have the standard wireless controller that comes with the Xbox and a gamestop controller I picked up for a friend.  I wouldn't say the standard controller is bad, but the Onza seems to respond a little better, it may just be in my head.

The thing I don't care for is the huge wire, wish there were a way to make it shorter, considering I'm less than 5 ft from the xbox, the 15ft wiring is a little excessive. The additional shoulder buttons I found can be useful, but in all honesty, after using the standard controller, I sometimes press the new shoulder buttons on accident, so it takes some time to getting used to if you usually don't have so many buttons.

Overall I'd say this is a good product by Razor, and better than most 3rd-party controllers if not all 3rd party controllers.

Edit: After using this controller for a bit more, I can say one final con to this thing for me are the XYAB buttons.  They either require too much force to press, and if you use too much, it sends forward 2 signals so its like you pressed it twice.  So basically, sometimes it'll be like you didn't push the button at all, and other times it'll be like you pushed it twice.

Also, The rubber on the rubberized left side joy-stick thing is coming off.  Of course, wear and tear is never covered by warranty, but this is just sad, not even one year of ownership.  Shoddy workmanship Razer","Good Controller, Bad Quality",1301356800,,{'Edition:': ' Standard Edition'},

for one its hard to control despite how simple the controls are, some of the challenges in the beginning of the game are nearly impossible to beat and the rating system. i thought it would be fair if the performance rating would average each rating such as turning and speed together, but no thats not the case, it takes the lowest grade and makes it the final grade, so if i got an A grade in everything and a D in turning, my overall grade would be a d. another thing, you are rated on how much you turn, which makes no sense because theres no reason to turn excessively  on courses where you are going straight down, or courses that require little turning, you should only turn as much as you need to. i have had it with this game.
how is this game so easy yet so hard, well when one of the training courses kept failing me cause i did not turn enough despite me turning the entire time. it was relatively easy to control cause i was getting used to the balance board, but it was failing me even though i did it right.

it is not all bad, i kind of like how when im playing the game at night time i have the option to choose to play the game in the night time setting, but thats not saying much.

i am usually the one not to complain about video game graphics, but these are just so bad, in some cases the graphics can get worse than the n64, like when people talk.

I enjoyed Borderlands 2, I thought it had some enjoyable coop but I quickly realized how the majority of fun came from the fact that I was playing with friends, not necessarily the game play.

This is not to say Borderlands 1 or 2 are bad games, they do what they set out to do well, and because of that I had faith that Gearbox would deliver at least a semi-decent product, but this game is one of the most shameful displays of a 2013 entertainment product that we will likely see all year.

First the cable is too stiff and you can CONSTANTLY hear it in the headset scrapping against your shirt.  You immediately become aware of just how much and how often your head moves.  This noise is horribly loud and annoying.  You can hear it even if the headset is not plugged into anything so this is a physical design issue.

The headset seems to work all of 20-30 seconds when using Google Voice, which was the primary reason I got them.  Then it just simply cuts out speaker and microphone, EVERY SINGLE TIME!  Basically useless.

It will however play music just fine.  I even tried playing music, then starting a call.  First it cut out the music, then the call, then a few seconds later the music cut back in.  That's reliability.

So I decided to download their drivers rather than relying on Windows 8.1 drivers.  Their drivers made all sound on my laptop useless.  Gone is the smart switch from the headset to the laptop speakers when I unplug the headset or the other way around.  So is the builtin ability to have a default sound system for playing music and a default system for communications.

Worst of all?  The drivers stop the ability to open Sound from Control Panel.  I rebooted, tried again, then went to uninstall their drivers/software.

I even forgave that abomination that was on the PS2 and was a blatant copy of Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance. But you as the consumer should know my point of view before you decide to throw 60.00 to Bethesda for something that you may or may not like.

Comparison: In comparison to Fallout 3/New Vegas, Fallout 4 tries to do too much all at once. I found myself agrivated with the game and a basic rest button was nowhere in sight. It is the kind of failure that I've seen in many of these newer games and it makes me violently ill.

Complexity: Really, what makes Fallout 4 such a garbage game is it's complexity. What made the other (successful) games good were their simplicity. They gave you enough information to understand what to do. In Fallout 4, this doesn't even seem to be the case.

Construction: So Fallout 4 lets you build and customize just about everything. It wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't so darn confusing to understand how to do somple things, like power a water purifier. On TOP of all that, you don't even get access to your direction finder, which I found to be dreadful. If they could actually simplify the building component to the game, it would be one of the most enjoyable for me.

Combat: I hate what they did to VATS. It worked much better when it froze time and let you do what you needed to do. The combat in Fallout 3/New Vegas were much better overall I think.

Perks: Perks replaced the Skills in Fallout 4 and again, don't like it very much. It's just a hazard suited for casual gamers and not really for people who were fans of games like Oblivion and Morrowind. There is just something that feels more natural about skills, then there is with perks.

Graphics: The graphics aren't really all that great in this game. It feels like they spent more time adding things that should never have existed in the first place. The graphics are just plain dull and uninteresting for what is basically a present/next generation game.

Story: You aren't looking for your dad that ran out on you and left you to deal with Vault 101. You are the mother/father of a son that was taken while you were in suspended animation. This becomes the focal point in the beginning of your journey. The problem is, it is as dull as the graphics.

I kept seeing those commercials and reviews and the game looks like Grand Theft Auto...I figured with 2 GTA games out on the PSP that played very similarly to it's console counterpart, that Scarface would be the same on the PSP. The commercials never showed how the PSP game looked, they just showed gameplay from the consoles and mentioned ""Also on the PSP"".

I went to purchase this game (NEW), opened it and popped it in. I saw nothing that resembled the gameplay on TV. It's basically gang wars, except you; the player do nothing but press and click. No skill needed whatsoever, just keep clicking away.

UPDATE:
5/16/2011
Okay, it's been quite some time now since I've played the game but I have some more info to add.... After playing the game for hours and hours on end, I noticed that the game gets progressively harder. Okay, I'm fine with that because I like a challenge, however, I do not like to be cheated. I put the game down for like a year now and the reason for that is because when you purchase cars that are RWD they have no control what so ever. The game got very disappointing and I set it down. The fact is that when you drift or race in the game it takes away the sense of realism that it first had. I didn't beat the game because no matter how hard I tried there were some races that were IMPOSSIBLE to even beat. AND I MEAN IMPOSSIBLE. Buy at your own risk, this rating when down for me because the game seriously sucks. IT'S FAKE, and the computers are cheaters. THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL that you could suck at this game after playing it for hours on end and have over 1 million dollars in it as well. That just goes to show you that I had the money, a lot of cars in the game, and I was winning, up until the part where they said the FWD cars are not permitted in the races of higher rankings. OKAY, so I buy multiple cars, soup them up to the max and STILL, the game turns out to be no fun.

I thought it was me but I handed it to a buddy of mine and after being so stubborn with it thinking that he could win he wound up putting the PSP down. I told him that it was bogus, but he had to see it for himself. And this isn't like he put the game down after like 10 mins, he spent like an hour or two on the SAME LEVEL!

Seriously, don't waste your money, BUY THE NEED FOR SPEED GAMES instead. I thought I was impressed by this game (which I was AT FIRST) but I'm going to go back to the NFS games. No more of this generic off brand wanna be NEED FOR SPEED GAMES....IT had potential to be a great game, but after a while when you hit the drifting races like when you have to score like a million points within 1 or 2 laps it gets frustrating. THERE IS NO WAY SOMEONE COULD ACTUALLY DO THAT....and if you do, then I will give you the props, but I just can't seem to do it, it seems unfair and I don't like that because they don't give you the satisfaction that you deserve. Come on man, scoring like 800,000 drift points is not enough for the game, and I was playing it a lot until I literally decided to set it down for my nerves. It's not worth my time, I'd rather go fix my car or do something with it like upgrading my lights or something. Just to show you that it sucks I edited this review. I normally wouldn't have even done it but when I was going through my reviews I read how happy I was with this game and I'm like oh no, ohhhhh no I need to fix this so that people do not make the same mistake as I did with this game. Good game UNTIL you reach the higher levels and then it gets ridiculous.

Mark my words, you might beat the game, but it will cost you your nerves because it does get frustrating. And for those who read the review and think to yourselves that I do not know how to play the game, go for it. That's your opinion, and you're entitled to it, but when you purchase the game and see what I'm talking about then you will understand what I'm saying. Or if you can beat the game like that (snaps fingers) then you obviously spent wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too much time with it to beat the game. Go out, throw a baseball around, play some catch, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.

- Who designs an MMO that is horrible to play with friends?
- Constant crashes
- Server disconnects
- 20 minute wait-time just to login
- Last-gen graphics
- Unnecessary and annoying dialogue
- Poor introductory mission

But most annoying, by far, is how they designed this game...  It is more fun to play alone than with a friend, even though it's an MMO!  If you play with a friend, none of your quests work together.  If you grab something, they have to grab it to.  If you unlock something, they have to do the same.  If you do a mission 'together,' you literally do the entire mission alone, even though you can see them and talk to them.  There's no working together AT ALL! It's just a glorified chat-room.

It's an extremely poorly designed game, with awful (non-existent) co-operative play, it's no fun with friends, and the developer clearly didn't learn from their Beta feedback.  Best of all, it constantly crashes, which boots you to the menu, where you have to wait in a queue (30 minutes +) to re-enter the game.  If you get kicked every 15 minutes, that means you play 15-20 minutes per hour of trying to play.  Pathetic.

1.0,True,"09 5, 2011",A27OW0P38B28OP,B002DC8GKE,Relytia,"I remember when I first saw Brink. It looked amazing, even a year and a half before release. Conceptually it looked awesome... when I saw it released to extremely poor reviews, I was disappointed and surprised. Then, I saw that the developer/publisher released DLC for FREE for the first two weeks of August, in order to try and get more people to play, because nobody is. They also did that as an apology for the poor saps who bought the game, and I am serious about that, not exaggerating or making that up whatsoever. Now, a mere THREE months after initial release, it is only 12$! 60$ to 12$ in three months!? If that that is not a sure sign of a bad game I don't know what is, but I was deceived by SOME positive user reviews and an extremely low price tag (as well as my own naivety) and bought it anyway. Boy was that a bad idea. }:(

Brink DOES do a couple of things well. Here they are:

- A ton of customization that really feels like there are infinite choices to shaping your character's appearance, weaponry, body type, and class.

- Pretty cool music, when the audio isn't completely glitching out.

- The story concept is very unique, and pretty cool. It's decent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waterworldish/dp/0783219857/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waterworldish</a>&nbsp;post-apocalyptic sci-fi, and I liked it quite a bit. However, ONLY the concept is good about the story.

- The art design matches the story CONCEPT well, meaning it is very unique, and overall it's pretty decent sci fi fare, if not boring and repetitive because there's two different types of environments. Variety is not a strength here.

Pretty much everything else sucks, terribly, which is very tragic, because *conceptually*, Brink has a ton going for it. Objection based 16-player matchmaking in such an interesting sci-fi apocalyptic setting sounds amazing, but... well... here's the bad, specifically:

- The AI is the worst I have ever encountered this generation. Either it's WAY too easy, OR, more likely, your teammates are completely idiotic morons who love to swan dive directly into headshots more gracefully than an Olympic synchronized swimming team. Opposite this team of fairies is a team of ultra SWAT commandos who also happen to have part-time jobs as Master Chief's stunt doubles. They're invincible, sharpshooting marksmen with brilliant neurosurgeon medics, super effective spy operatives, or rocket science engineers. You on the other hand, have a team that arrives on the short bus who die immediately or wonder around nowhere near anything important the entire drudge of a match. It's so frustrating. Now here's an argument to those jerks who say only unskilled players hate this game: I would like to point out that I play shooters fairly often. Not enough to be a MLG gamer, mind you, and not a TON of multiplayer, but I still consider myself a pretty decent gamer. I play video games a lot, and I find the game unplayable. So there.

- What makes my preceding point about atrocious bot AI worse is that, because this game sucks, nobody ever plays it so you'll end up with AI bots way more often than not. In my time playing the game, I was lucky if I had ONE other player with me in a match. Let's do some math: 1(me)+ 1 other person = 2 actual people playing in a supposedly SIXTEEN-player match... Remember, this is supposed to be a 100% MULTI-PLAYER GAME! GAH!!!

- Even if a match has as little as two people, the lag is so bad at times it is unplayable. I'm not kidding. With more, just say goodbye to any meaningful gameplay whatsoever, as if that was there to begin with (It's OK, you can pretend there was, if it makes you feel better).

- The level and mission design is horrendous. This is how a game of Brink will often play out: You have 12 minutes to blow up a door, so you die, then respawn way on the other side of the map, then you run for thirty seconds to get to the objective, die, respawn, then run for 30 seconds, actually plant a charge on the door, get shot and killed along all seven other members of your team by two enemy bots, the enemy undoes what you just accomplished, respawn, run, die, respawn, run, die.... *vomits*... well, you get the idea. It's this cycle ad nauseum for the duration of the time limit until it's over and you lose. OR you win within two minutes and it's not fun that way either. Talk about incredible frustration. It's a joke. Levels are designed where you're directed into choke-points directly in the line of sight of protected enemies.

- The ""SMART"" system which was supposed to take an awesome game,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mirror-s-Edge/dp/B00149PCAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mirror's Edge</a>, and shove it down Brink's throat. It's an awesome idea. It's terribly implemented. You can't tell what is traversable, and more often than not, it fails and you're left stumbling around, probably getting shot.

- The story is awesome, in premise. In execution, it's nonexistent, and the ""small touches"" like all the characters yelling out what they're going to do like a bunch of annoying Rastafarian rebels is really obnoxious. Ugh.

- The sound, in my copy anyway, glitched out constantly. I was terrified that my new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ASTRO-A40s/dp/B004N7HSGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ASTRO A40s</a>&nbsp;were actually broken inside. No, they're fine (and awesome). This piece of trash is what's broken, in yet ANOTHER way.

- On one map, I stopped and waited for, wait for this, TEN ENTIRE SECONDS for the graphical textures to pop in... still with me? Ok, well, I paused and another FIVE SECONDS LATER, MORE detail popped into place. Remember I haven't moved this entire time. I waited to see another layer pop in, but it never did. Do you know why I kept waiting? Because they were fully loaded, but still looked to be one or two layers away from today's generation graphics. The art design is decent, if not boring and repetitive, but the graphical implementation of them is shockingly bad!

Seriously, I cannot word strongly enough how tragic this game is. It had so much potential, but fails so utterly in every possible way that it is downright irredeemable. I will say this, if this game actually HAD players on it, it MAY be a two-star game. However, you can't even experience that because nobody likes this game and so there are no other players to game with. A real shame. What I'm wondering is how in the H-E-doublehockeysticks did this go through both Splash Damage AND Bethesda without somebody noticing the glaring flaws. This game is truly a travesty to gaming everywhere. I am shocked this released. It needed another year or two, at least, to bring it up to today's standards. Too bad. I also must point out that I NEVER write such negative reviews of anything on here. I always try to put every commonly perceived flaw into context to make it a little more understandable. I literally cannot do that with this garbage. It's beyond redemption. 1-star game, and while it's not THEE worst game ever, it is the worst one I've personally played in a long while.

This game deserves nothing more than a funeral in my toilet, along with other materials you typically flush down the John, because that is what this game is... avoid it like the stinking, fly-ridden pile it is, seriously!

Edit: A month after writing this review, the game is now $9.99 NEW, and $6 USED! It is literally 1/6th the price it released at new, and 1/10th(!) if you get it used. That is a massive depreciation in value over the pathetic time frame of just five months... I am shocked... but then again, I shouldn't be, considering how bad this game is. Honestly friends, I'm just trying to spare you the agony this game will put you through, as well as save your wallet some funds for when the real games come out this Holiday season. The dramatic price drop should be the final nail in the coffin you need.

First off, what it does right:
-An insane number of cars, over 400 in the box and tons more are downloadable (usually for a fee)
-Lots of tracks, 100+ options in the box and more for download (again, usually for a price)
-The best customization on consoles, including on-the-fly adjustments that can be made while testing the car, so you don't have to go back and forth between loading screens to test out adjustments
-The livery editor is unmatched, letting you paint and decal your cars to a ridiculous degree- if you can dream it, you can build it

With all of this, you'd imagine this is a five-star game. The driving really is technically perfect, and the best simulation you can get on consoles. However, the downsides start to rear their head.

First off, the game is totally soulless. 1,000 horsepower monster cars just drift forward, when they should be shaking your driver's teeth loose. The system fails to model the complex bumps and divots that real race tracks have, so the car just floats along. Before the developers patched in an update, your driver didn't even shift when using the first-person mode, the computerized hands just stayed glued to the wheels. This was okay in previous installations in the series since few games could manage that level of realism, but in the time since the last Forza many other titles (Project Gotham racing, GRID...) have better captured incredibly intense bumping and jarring and terror of driving a race car at speed. Driving a million-dollar supercar in Forza 3 is, frankly, just boring.

Multiplayer is awful, and this affects the singleplayer game. In most singleplayer or ""career"" modes, you win a number of prize cars through the game for completing various challenges. Normally, you can resell these prize cars for a good chunk of change, in order to upgrade cars you want. Instead, the developers decided to integrate selling cars into the multiplayer experience, so you can only auction off cars to other people. Since everyone wins the same cars, you're basically stuck with whatever you get and it's much harder to earn money toward things you really want to do in game. The online racing is also awful. As an example, the developers also pulled support for playlists for anyone who wants to race sub-A-class cars, meaning online racing is basically limited to race-tuned and supercars against strangers, there's nothing catering to people who want to race regular stock cars in leagues, which is a massively popular demographic.

And the grind. As mentioned, you can't resell prize cars for money, so you're stuck grinding away getting cash from race prizes. Races only really grant money if you finish in the top 3 and specifically in first place, so you'll basically have to win every single race to build money. A normal race might net you up to $20,000 of in-game cash, when there are cars that cost $20 million. That's 1,000 races (and you have to win every single one, while avoiding damage to your car). There are longer races that net more money, but then you could wind up spending literally hours to finish a single race, for only a fraction of the money that you need. It's basically impossible to net all the cars you're going to want, unless you're going to spend a ridiculous amount of time playing and manipulating the online auctions.

The damage modeling is laughable. The developers did a great job modeling small bits of damage, like windshields cracking from impacts or bumpers crumpling from a hit, so things look impressive at a glance. However, you quickly learn that all damage is preset- if the front corner takes (x) damage, it will look like crumple effect (y). And if you take a big hit, prepare for the surprise. The front bumper of your car might crumple when you hit a wall, but the chassis will be fine even if you slam facefirst into concrete at 200mph. If you manage to flip your car, it rolls around like a children's toy, and you can hold the left stick to make your car roll itself back over like a turtle shaking its flippers to roll over. This is just plain stupid, and it looks ridiculous in game.

So the final impression I was left with, is that that developers spent tens of millions of dollars scanning every lug nut on a car to ensure total accuracy, but then they let you roll your flipped car over with the flick of a magic wand. It's just... dumb. So much money and effort is spent on such a lifeless package.

I know because I received this controller today, used it for an hour, went and bought a licensed WiiU Pro controller at my local Target and am using it now, the difference is NIGHT and DAY in terms of fine control capabilities of these controllers.

These knock offs would work fine if you have kids playing mario kart, but if you are playing a game like Breath of the Wild and you want detailed, minute aiming control of your ranged weapons this controller will be a complete disappointment.

The WiiU gamepad thumbsticks are excellent and track motion with a very high level of granular detail, so you can move either very very slowly or very rapidly.  This knock-off controller does NOT have that granular level of control, you're either not moving at all or suddenly moving at full speed, see below.  For singular input such as ""turn right"" or ""turn left"" that's fine, but when you need to carefully aim a bow so that you get a head shot you simply can't do it with this knock off controller unless you just get lucky.

The actual WiiU Pro controller uses the same excellent thumbsticks as the Gamepad.  These knock offs use garbage thumbsticks that are all on or all off.  No good.

Seems decent quality and worked fine with my WiiU in terms of pairing and all buttons working, BUT thumbstick deadzone is huge and acceleration is 100% when you finally get out of the deadzone.  Precise aiming is not possible.

If you care at all about stealth accuracy with ranged weapons in a game like Zelda BOTW this controller is NOT good.  When aiming the bow reticle with the right thumbstick there is a HUGE deadzone (where there is no movement at all while moving the thumbstick) then once you get out of the deadzone acceleration is instantly almost 100%.

For the non-tech nerds, that means:  You aim the bow, move the thumbstick... nothing happens.... move it more... nothing happens... move it a little more and suddenly the aim point moves an inch across the screen.  You simply CAN'T aim accurately with this controller.

I have no idea if the authorized WiiU pro controller does it better, but I'll be finding out since I'm going to order one.",Seems decent quality and worked fine with my WiiU in terms of pairing and all ...,1498521600,2,{'Color:': ' PG-original'},

Starting off with the original Postal game in 1997, it was a gritty, intelligent and funny, which made it one of the most unique IP on the market. Eight years later after Postal 2, the postal series has finally returned to conclude the trilogy. What could have been a great game is instantly turned it into a cosmic mess with no clear direction, outdated controller and horrible game design. Postal III isn't just the worst downloadable game I have ever played, it is by far the worst game I have ever played. Unknown Object

One of the first problems you're going to spot is the overall story. The Story is focused around you as you play as The Postal Dude, your average muscular dude who got thrown into a situation he has to solve. The Story in Postal III has no clear direction and no goal on where it wants it take you. It is seemly just another comedic sketch over and over again.

Postal III puts you in a post apocalyptic world, but it never quit feels like it. You never get the sense that you are isolate, on the run and need to survive.  Majority of your time you spend in small town called Catharsis. The streets are always filled with people and the city looks un-scratched from the post apocalyptic climate. All together, you never get the sense that they are in danger and you are never enriched in the setting. One of the many reasons the setting is toned down is because it is trying to provide the comedic attitude that the series is known for.

Weapon Madness

Through out the game, what would be missions or quests in similar games are replaced with comedic sketches that fail to be funny.  Right off the bat, you are tossed into situation that for the most part are hit and miss. There are some sketches that will give you a laugh, but they are very far in between. Along the way, you will come across a few celebrities who lend their talents to the game, but the problem is that they are given little to work with and are poorly executed.

In one of the first missions of the game after you complete the prologue, you are forced to do the most absolutely insane jobs in order to re-fuel your car. From vacuuming up tissues off the floor in a sex shop and shooting them right back at the customers. To helping a local terrorist group battle Osama Bin Laden by rounding up diseased cats. To lastly killing off an angry mob of Mexican -Sushi restaurateurs. Many will enjoy it for it comedic attitude, but it quickly gets old due how linear the game is. What really diminishes the comedic aspect of the game is the dreadful presentation.

The Monkey Might be the best part of Postal III

Unknown Object

Postal III has been in development for eight years, which is one of the longest development cycles in recent memory. You would of thought that the franchise would make leaps and bounds, but the exact opposite happen. Previously, the engine driving the Postal franchise was Epic's Unreal engine. In Postal III however, Running With Scissors developed the product under Valve's Steam engine. The results in glitchy experience that looks outdated filled with inexcusable errors for a current gen product.

The graphics are by far the worst thing Postal III brings to the table. The graphics are in creditable out dated. Shadows and textures pop in and out. Facial textures look awful. These graphics are no shape or form acceptable for current gen hardware. What makes it worse are the annoying glitches in the game.

At Least France Dosen't have to Play this shit

Far too often, your progress in the game will be stopped at a stand still. To entire area's blacked out because of the extra time need to load part of the map. By far the worse glitch I experienced, was my entire save vanishing from my game. Making my experience more troublesome then it should have be. Another problem I had was the dialogue in the game. Far too often characters fail to lip - sync to the script, resulting in an ugly result. For the most part it will appear that characters are mumbling through the script, making actors performance look below par and highly unforgettable.

These things should have been ironed out with beta testing, but you can tell this was something they overlooked or skipped entirely. Post apocalyptic wastelands are a mess to go through, but Postal III graphical wasteland tops it all. In many ways, I wish Valve stopped this game from hitting store shelves and give them more time to clean up these mistakes. All this could have been forgiven if the gameplay was decent but it follows a very similar path. Promo Art

Postal III has perhaps has the weirdest shooting set up I have had to deal with recently. For the PC, you can only shoot by right clicking on the mouse and you aren't given control to arc your grenade. Besides grenades, there are some truly bizarre guns that are fun to fool around with. You want variety with your gunplay, well here you go as every gun plays differently while providing a few laughs in the process.

The Gunplay is sufficient, but I wish I could tweak things around in the settings. If your looking for something groundbreaking and original. You're simply not going to get it with it taking little or no chances. Postal III focuses squarely on its comedic attitude.

I don't know who I should more mad at, Postal III for giving me everything I didn't want out of a game or the developers themselves. I can't believe that the people behind Running with Scissors would take eight years to put out one of the worst games I have ever played. Then to make things worse, every time you die a developer will flash onto the screen and give you the middle figure. I can understand and respect a developer who knows that their product isn't great, but don't you dare make fun of the people who support you day in and day out.

Simply put, Postal III is an injustice to game design and most importantly an injustice to loyal fans of the franchise. If Running With Scissors was trying to develop a product that was so bad, it made Duke Nukem Forever look good. Then after eight long years, you can say that it's the only thing they accomplished.

1.0,False,"12 21, 2011",A2EV4250MPLXLK,B000WRZTAC,Kalaab M. Pickering,"I recently purchased this controller for my wife to play Twilight Princess on the Wii (we both prefer the Gamecube edition over the Wii version) and we were both sorely disappointed.  Functionally, this gamepad worked as advertised, meaning it connects using a 2.4ghz wireless connection to communicate with a receiver connected to your controller port on your Wii or Gamecube.  However, the performance and feel of this control leave much to be desired.

Firstly, it should be noted that we used this controller within reasonable proximity to the receiver (less than 10 feet).  Even still, we consistently lost connection with the receiver, resulting in having to sync the controller mid-game.  When this happens, however, you don't get the handy ""your controller is unplugged"" message in the game since the receiver is still plugged in, so while you're pressing buttons to re-sync your controller, events are occuring in your game as normal and without input.

The biggest gripe I had with this controller was the feel of it.  The size of this controller is about 3/4ths the size that it should be.  I thought at first it was because I have large hands, but my wife had the same problem and her hands are quite a bit smaller than mine.  In addition, the button layout is counter-intuitive.  The buttons themselves are small to the point that it's hard to hit the one you want, or hit one button without accidentally hitting another.  This controller adheres to the Xbox/PS button layout (which I prefer and was a selling point to me when I ordered this unit), but my wife  and I both found that the original Gamecube controller layout, as quirky as it was, feels much more natural than this gamepad.  Even if it was of proper size, I believe this would still be undesirable, as the Gamecube controller layout positions the A button as the large, central, primary button, with the B, X, and Y buttons as smaller satellite buttons. As such, a lot of games place emphasis on the A button as the primary input.  Since the more more natural feel for controllers designed like the Thrustmaster is to have the primary input button be in the Y or B button location (Square and X button on PS controllers, respectively), the habits and muscle memory that my wife and I have developed using those controllers is at odds with the controller's layout.

For those who use the D-Pad a lot in games, I will report that the D-pad's location on this controller is much preferred over the original Gamecube's location (beneath the left analog stick), but the pad on this controller is mushy and unresponsive.

At this point I must concede that one of the features this controller offers is the ability to remap the button inputs, which is a great feature at this price point, but even with a custom layout my wife and I both found that we were fighting this controller due to it's physical proportions more than anything.

I can't recommend this controller to anyone who frequently plays Gamecube games.  Your milage may vary, of course, but I have always found the best gaming experiences had to have a control setup that was transparent.  I found that the more thought I put into modifying my playing style and attempting to hit only the intended buttons, the less engaged I was to the game I was playing.  This was a source of a lot of frustrations.",Not Recommended,1324425600,,,
1.0,False,"12 8, 2001",A18M16Q7UC511A,B00005O628,PKHauntUS,"I really wanted to enjoy ""The Simpson's: Road Rage"" because I am to the point where I pity the ""The Simpson's"" license in the context of the incredibly competitive video game world. The last string of ""Simpson's"" games have been nothing but complete, almost unplayable disasters. It's not saying a whole lot when I hear people are raving that ""Road Rage is THE best Simpson's game!"" Yes, it is the most competent ""Simpson's"" game undoubtedly but still somehow manages to a sad, highly unoriginal bore.

""Hello. Am I speaking to the legal department of Electronic Arts? Yes, this is the legal team at Sega America and we are just calling to let you know that we are suing you breaking copyright."" How that call never happened is beyond me. ""Road Rage"" rips EVERYTHING from the stellar Sega hit ""Crazy Taxi"" except the fun! Considering Sega's title is way over a year old so it's very peculiar that ""Road Rage"" in no way, shape or form decides to build on the ""taxi"" formula and make it into something of it's own. Yes, ""Road Rage"" has arguably better graphics (considering the hardware leap from Dreamcast to XBOX, it's nothing to write home about), many more vehicles and arenas, faster gameplay and the occasional hilarity of ""The Simpson's"" license but the gameplay surprisingly is nowhere as fun, challenging or deep as Sega's ""Crazy Taxi.""

There are 4 gameplay modes: Road Rage, Sunday Drive, Mission Mode and Head to Head. The premise of ""Road Rage"" is simple. You choose one of various Simpson's characters, drive around picking up various Simpson's characters and drop them off as quickly as possible while listening to audio excerpts of the characters dialog repeat. Depending on how quickly you delivered your passenger the higher the pay you receive. Sounds mighty familiar hey? This cycle is fun for about an hour then torturous soon after. ""Road Rage's"" in game clock is incredibly inconsistant and will sometimes give you less then 5 seconds to get your passenger to their destination a few blocks away when you still have a fair amount of time left of total game time or it'll give you 40 seconds to drive one block; it flat out kills the fun. Sunday Drive is exactly what the title implies; driving around town with no time limit or objectives exploring the arena's whatnots. Mission Mode is a pathetic, abundantly unfun exercise in running various objects over within a set amount of time. Head to Head is the only reason to play this game. The 2-player madness can be very entertaining but Head to Head has lame restrictions and doesn't flow as seemlessly (I mean this very loosely) as the 1-Player experience.

Cars or characters - which ever you want to call them - handle one of three ways. There are the fast cars are extremely touchy (Apu's Sports Car), balanced cars that have a satisfactory top speed and handle adequately but sound like they are stuck in second gear (Marge's 4x4 Canonaro) and the slow, borderline useless clunkers (Auto's School Bus). Most people will find themselves sticking to the unforgiving, speed orientated cars because once mastered (which doesn't take a whole lot of time) domination is inevitable.

The arenas range from o.k. to barely playable. ""Evergreen Terrace"" and the ""Entertainment District"" are the most balanced levels and the majority of gamers will find themselves playing those two most often. While their premise is novel arenas like ""The Springfield Dam"" and ""Springfield Mountains"" are too difficult to navigate due to their immensity and poor level design. ""Downtown"" suffers from sporadic slowdown and frame-rate dives that create a slightly nauseating experience. Roads in these are too narrow and hitting the side of the course can bring your cars to a complete stop. Not to mention Mr. Burns and his entirely spastic ""atomic buses"" blocking the road entirely and pushing your car into walls will leave an extremely bitter taste in your mouth.

Graphically ""Road Rage"" in really nothing to get excited over. The colorful, Simpson'esque atmosphere is suiting but visuals aren't as crisp as one should expect from the XBOX. There is a minor texture blur that reminds me a great deal - to a lesser degree - of the graphical style of the N64 title ""South Park.""

I am really happy the voice actors from the TV series recorded some new material for the game. I am really annoyed that they recorded so little. Phrases are very funny the first 10 or so times, but by the time the second or third game loads up using the same character you will have had it. Lisa, one of my favorite character on the show has very few things to say and soon becomes unmistakably irritating. Same can be said for the almost the entire cast of characters.

Lastly I have to touch on how unacceptably glitchy ""Road Rage"" is. I've had cars get stuck on walls, in the middle of the road and occasionally get stuck onto another car. Sometimes I had to quit the game because my car was wedged indefinitely. The collision detection needs a great deal of work. I can't tell you the last time I played a game where if you got enough air time you could fly through background scenery into gray, video game limbo and float there until your time eventually expires. Also the load times, which are nowhere near as horrible as the PS2 version's, are still noticeably bad. Consider how low tech this game appears and how powerful the XBOX is, the time spent at the ""Now Loading..."" screen is utterly unsatisfactory. ""Road Rage"" has ""rushed"" plastered all over it.

Don't waste your hard-earned cash on this uninspired rip-off. I heard Sega will eventually port ""Crazy Taxi 2"" to the XBOX. I recommend investing in the originator, not settling for a half-baked designer imposter.",Doh,1007769600,,,

However, as I opened the box (not the one from Amazon, but the actual Thrustmaster box) I realized there were small plastic pieces laying around. I realized the wheel was poorly packaged and therefore there was a crack on the plastic with a hole above it. Not big deal really, yes it was broken but I wouldn't return it just for that. However after I installed the drivers I realized (on the windows test screen) that the brake pedal is completely dead. I did my best around re-installing drivers, looking for updates for drivers, nothing changed (of course it wouldn't, the drivers were just right the first time).

Then to top it off, 2 out of the 3 racing games that I tried the wheel on didn't work right away. In both Need for Speeds the wheel was working fine through the menus but not in the actual race. So while I'm sure I could've found a solution with some research, I decided to re-pack the wheel and send it for a exchange due to the defective pedal and broken steering wheel plastic.

There is also a lot of DRM. You can't even play a local game on your computer without connecting to Battle.net. The game also requested that I open many ports on my firewall. None of the other games that I own do this.

The game designers also made stupid choices for no apparent reason. For example, you can only change your name once! Why is there a limit at all? That makes no sense!

The campaign mode is terrible. The designers didn't separate the tutorial from the campaign. So, in the campaign, the game gradually lets you build different units. For example, in the second mission you only have Marines, Medics, SCVs, Barracks, Command Center, and Supply Depot. Each new mission introduces a new unit or building that you can use. This is a pathetic way to make a campaign. I wish that on the first mission you had access to all units and buildings. Also, the first 10 missions are extremely boring.

The achievements at the end of each stage are also stupid. The game doesn't tell you what you need to do to earn the achievements before or during the mission. Then, at the end of the mission you will realize that you didn't complete all of the achievements because you didn't know what the achievements were. Also, if you want to replay the stage in order to get the achievements, you will have to reload the game at an earlier save. You can't easily replay a stage in order to get a higher score.","Terrible campaign, too much DRM, don't believe the hype",1328400000,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

When I first got them they were a little bit of a pain to get on the controller, but once on, they were nice. The little nubs helped to keep a hold of the controller when the action got intense and my hands got sweaty. For that reason, I gave these 2 stars.

The trouble starts when you want to charge them. I have a charging dock that the controllers slide into to charge. Needless to say the covers have to be removed to place on the charger. Not a big deal, BUT beware, if you have just finished playing and want to charge the controller, you have probably been playing for a short while and the controller is warm from your body heat as is the cover. This is where the problem starts, at least for me. As I was removing the cover, something I had done many times before, a small tear occurred on the back side on the inside of the hand grip area. Over time and more use this tear grew to the point of the cover being useless. Then the second cover, one that I did not use as much, started to feel sticky. I washed it in warm water, seemed to help some.

Since silicone is prone to getting this sticky feeling and my wife has some silicone backing items that she cleans in the dishwasher I thought it would be safe and sanitary to clean these covers in the dishwasher. I do not heat dry my dishes, I let them air dry and the covers got the same treatment. The second one became real loose fitting and at this point they both ended up in the garbage.

If you are looking for something to add to your controllers for some better grip and game play, look for Real Triggers, here on Amazon. They are like five bucks a set and clip on the L2 & R2 buttons and make them stick out a bit more making it easier to hold and feels more like a trigger from a gun.

BAD: DRM nightmare. LAN play crippled. BattleNet is a huge pain, but you have to use it.  Can't play in different time zones. Can't spawn. Internet connection required. Paying customers treated like criminals. GREEEEED: it's only actually 1/3 of the game.  Look forward to the whole game costing you $180 (not for any special editions either).

Blizzard has likely hammered home the final nail in its coffin as a studio that ""gets it"".  What a huge difference between this and the original--and definitely NOT in a good way.  I pay for games.  I do not advocate piracy.  So why then, do pirates get a superior product?  Yes, the cracked version is already available all over the place, and that version lacks what makes this product so distasteful.

Having been a huge fan of the first game, I was bitterly disappointed that this one is so crippled, as well as being incomplete.  There comes a point where the bottom line of profit is directly impacted by one's reputation.  Blizzard took a running jump over it this time.  They went from one of the most respected studios on the planet to an entity that makes EA and Apple look positively enlightened by comparison.  To be fair, it is perhaps Activision that is to blame, but most folks will not take that into consideration.

Piracy is here to stay, as long as there are people who simply refuse to pay $60 for a computer game.  Thus far, no one has produced any DRM capable of stopping it (or even significantly reducing it).  The DRM does do a fine job of annoying the paying customers though. Why studios fail to see this is beyond me.  I suppose whoever builds DRM solutions has a really good sales team. Meanwhile, those who pirate the game get a better version than the one we pay for.

Luckily for Blizzard, the anticipation for this game was so frenzied that they will do quite well, I'm sure.  Millions have already purchased it.  I'm just wondering how many returns they will get.  They'll get one from me, that's all I can say for certain.  It will also be interesting to see how well they do selling the second and third parts, as well as any future games.  My guess is that they won't get quite the numbers they expect, unless changes are made.

Statistics have proven time and again that having even the most draconian DRM does nothing to reduce piracy, and that those who release a game without it somehow manage to do just fine (if it's a good game).  Some studios have learned this lesson.  Mass Effect 2 is a good example.  I happily purchased that game, after passing on the first one due to its DRM.

Unfortunately EA sports has not made any improvements to the game, but they have also ruined it by trying to make it more realistic(!). I'm not complaining because I can't win ,I just won my season one championship last week so I know how to play. The point is that FIFA 14 is not fun anymore...

What EA has failed to understand is that video games are meant to be fun. when you attempt to make a game realistic (in your own thoughts), you should consider the fact that it must not spoil the fun. As you can read in other reviews there are many many many issues that happen way too often in a game which makes you want to break your game. Just to mention a few:

- super sluggish game-play and increased momentum of players
- Easy cross and header goals that happen way too much in every game (Trust me, I also score most of my goals this way)
- Dribbling with the best players in the world is almost impossible because of super late reactions and movements
- Lofted through balls (which was so bad in the beginning that EA released a patch to fix it in the first few weeks)
- Unrealistic first touch controls (sometimes players like messi seem to have no idea how to stop an easy pass)
- Ridiculously foolish team-mates (some things are totally out of your control...)
- Forwards are in offside position 90% of the time (and don't seem to care at all!)

Overall, after a game (specially at higher levels) you don't feel like you won the game because you're good. Instead you feel like you only won because you were lucky. That's what kills the fun in a sports game.

The first ""re-release"" came about about the time of Episode 3.  About 6 months later, the game was re-released as the ""NGE"" i.e. ""New Game Experience"".  After upsetting its player base to the point of a mass exodus to other games such as World of Warcraft, EvE Online, and others - SOE redesigned the game *AGAIN* and has re-released it in this ""Complete Adventures"" set.  About six months ago it was the ""Starter Kit"".  And in about another month it will be released *AGAIN* as part of the  ""Best of Star Wars"" gift set.

This game is in perpetual Alpha/Beta state depending on how much code they delete between patches.  It is not fun at all anymore.

the auto aim is horrible and will get you killed way more than it ever helps you. its a rectangle box that you cant move from target to target during a shootout w/out letting off the z button and turning bonds whole body toward where you want to re target. so it many times targets a guy behind a crate who you cant shoot until he pops up anyway, but then theres a guy to the left or right shooting at you from out in the open and many times killing you because you cant move the target over quickly like in EON. it also targets propane tanks and such all the time instead of actual enemies. which is ok if its done only in a bond sence type thing like EON, that way you can chose.
next is the health meter, its brought over from COD unfortunately. this heath meter shouldn't be in any game unless your wolverine or some other character w/ a healing factor. bond is not 1 nor are COD marines. having to find cover every 2 seconds is so annoying, just have a regular heath meter and some body armor scattered around missions. and once your dead your dead!
then you have the ai for the enemies which after the first mission just get repetitive and boring. after you just run through mission after mission killing a small army worth of guys who btw act like soldiers from COD not thugs. and as such it seems most of the time like your just clearing out bunkers from a COD knockoff w/ different graphics. i know this was built off a COD platform but i think 007 is a big enough title to have its own platform and maybe have other games designed off it. also when you use 1 platform for many games the player shouldn't be able to detect it so easily. the hand to hand is basically 1 button push, w/ very little imput from you. and theres no combinations or different ways to take out enemies like in EON.
the missions themselves have the occasional cool part but those are few and far between. and overall this is the most restrictive 007 ever, its go here/ do this/ kill this/ etc. w/ very little imput from the game player. theres no 2 ways of doing something and therefore very boring and easily forgettable.
theres more but i think ill leave it at that for a store web page. i never thought id long for the days of EA making bond again. they had more misses that hits but they did have EON. if QOS is the future of this series this just might kill it.

That's what you can expect  with this trash game. Come on EA. You're killing it, I mean, killing your franchise!

Anyway...I can't believe what EA has done to destroy this beloved franchise. First off, know that Criterion (Burnout and Hot Pursuit devs) They did not make this game. This atrocity was made by an entity called Ghost. In a nutshell, this game is complete garbage. Oh Criterion, you are missed already... You're better of sticking in a 10 year old NFS game then play this. Read on.

I could barely get through this hour of play time.  First issue,  almost everything in this game is recycled from NFS Rivals and I wasn't a big fan of that one either but hey if the gameplay is great? Give it a chance right? But no, like others have mentioned, this is nothing but a copy and paste of Rivals.  Yea EA being EA! The B actors they hired are absolutely detestable and you're forced to listen to their tripe and these cut scenes are so bad I want cringe. You will get sick. Grab the barf bags. There's more videos of atrocious cut scenes than you are actually driving the car. Can we leave videos to youtube and not for video games? Even worse, you can't skip it. The fast and furious rendition attempts to  come into play and you'll laugh listening to these idiots, but the worst part, (nope, you can't skip it).

Anyway, when you finally get to drive, you are engulfed with obtrusive text boxes that cover the screen, while you're driving I might add and you have to constantly press B to get rid of it before you crash. After about 15 closures of text books I didn't want to read and constantly being interrupted, the driving finally comes into play. At first glance, I have to say, it's probably the prettiest night time driving I've ever seen.  The cars are purty, very well detailed, and nice cosmetical damage. But...

The good stops there.  The driving itself is borderline bad. The drifting? Um, I'll say this, ""what drifting?"" There is no drifting that I could see or pull out, I felt completely out of control of my ride.  I've felt better handling on Rad Racer for the NES.  And of course, no surprise. No Dash view hurts too, I love seeing the old dashboard in the old NFS games, none of that here. The game is apparently online online ONLY and I of course was having server issues geting into a game too.  Network lag was HORRIBLE and I kept glitching out back to the beginning of a race. I got booted out of a mission right in the middle of the game, and I just had to wait to go back.  Okay, I'm done. Thanks for the beta demo and calling it a complete game.

Just a note. I only played the XBOX One trial but I was originally planning on getting it for ps4, but I assume the ps4 version will be nearly identical.",Anyone who says this game is a great driving game needs their head examined.,1446595200,12,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It looks really cool and it worked for exactly one minute before everything went terribly wrong.

The people I was playing with said the mic made me sound like a Dalek that even the other Daleks wouldn't be able to understand, causing them to label me as ""imperfect"" and exterminate me with extreme prejudice.

Throat mics are a viable technology to send your voice clearly to other people, I've met people who use them for paintball several years ago.  I got this one for $20, which seemed like a good price at the time...

My biggest complaint is that all shots by the enemy AI are predetermined whether they will hit you or not. This part of the game is beyond frustrating. Whenever you try to duck behind cover it doesn't matter because once that bullet is launched its gonna hit you one way or the other. All evasive maneuvers are pointless. On top of this, if you stumble upon an enemy and blow him away, he falls back and stumbles as bullets hit him. Magically he can still fire, his gun is pointed straight at the ground, but you can watch the bullet fly out and still hit you, even if his back is to you. The enemy also always knows where you are unless there on patrol. Patrollers you can sneak up on and kill, however, everyone else is always pointing there gun at you. Its rather frustrating walking around a corner to find a fortress with everyone's gun already pointed at you. The damage model is also horrendous. It always takes three shots to kill someone with a basic rifle and more with a pistol or submachine gun. The only headshot that actually kills someone is the sniper rifle. The enemies are also everywhere, you have to search every single corner of every single house, because there is always some random guy cowering in a corner just waiting for you to pass by. This is not unrealistic per say, it just that there are hundreds of them.

1.0,False,"09 21, 2010",A3B0SZ3FD4LHL5,B004774IPU,Brian W.,"First I'd like to say that I'm a long time Civilization fan, and as such this review will be comparing Civilization 5 to the previous iterations of the game. If you are new to the Civilization world and have not been exposed to any of the previous games, this review is not for you as I will be expressing very biased opinions on the improvements (or lack thereof) that Civilization 5 brings.

This game is a large departure from Civilization 4...so much so that I barely even recognize it, and I'm not even sure where to begin. The graphics are vastly inferior to Civilization 4 and look quite childish, which is a shame because Civ 4 really had good things going for it in this respect. In Civ 4, when your units would walk through forests or jungles, birds would sometimes fly away from your disturbance. This doesn't happen in Civ 5. Coming from Civ 4, I'd even say the graphics for Civ 5 are down right ugly. All the trees look the same and all of the different tile sets for deserts, flood plains, tundra, etc. look like the developers hired the cheapest artist they could find to draw everything. Even the rivers are so bland looking there were a couple of times I mistook them to be border outlines for whichever computer player was blue in color. The wheat fields are especially awful as they look like some kid scribbled yellow/gold on the tile. I even had to double check that I had turned all of the graphics options to the highest level.

Another aspect that bugged me was that you can't zoom in very much to view any real detail of your cities or anything else. In Civ 4 you could zoom in quite close and view a lot of detail of your units, cities, and the beautiful terrain. But not in Civ 5. Perhaps it's better this way since everything looks so bad to begin with.

Also in Civ 4, when you moved your units their footsteps would make different sounds depending on the type of terrain you were in. If you were in a flood plain or other marshy tile, the footsteps would have a squishy sound. If you were in a glasslands or hill tile, the footsteps would have a thumping sound. You would also be able to see actual footprints from your legged units on most terrain when they moved. All of this doesn't hardly occur at all in Civ 5.

Whenever you completed building a world wonder in Civ 4, you would be shown a short video of the wonder being constructed to completion. It was quite a nice reward for spending so much time trying to complete such a large project. This doesn't happen in Civ 5. Instead you are only shown a still picture of the wonder. It's almost as if the developers wanted you to think that wonders are nothing to get excited about. I definitely started to feel that way after building my first couple of wonders. They also don't give you as much of a bonus in Civ 5 either, so I found myself not even wanting to build them anymore and instead focus on building military units.

Which brings me to another gripe. Even if you have a strong army, it's nearly impossible to take a city. Your military units get bombarded as they approach and it's DEVASTATING! Even when you get close enough to attack, cities are extremely strong and WILL KILL most of your attacking units. And since you can't stack units anymore (only one unit per tile, unless you have a Great General which are extremely rare to come by) it's a major pain to mount any kind of attack on even the weakest city. I suppose this is good in certain ways if you aren't a war-monger, but it was VERY annoying for me as I like to expand my empire by taking over others.

The hex tiles are a little annoying also, but that's just because I've been used to squares for so long. The problem isn't really hex tiles per se, but hex tiles plus the one-unit-per-tile restriction. It's not so bad until you are trying to move military units around. It gets to be quite cumbersome if you have more than 3 or 4 military units that you are trying to get to the same general area. To me, this is the main reason why someone would stop trying to win the game by destroying all other factions and just try to win a cultural or space race victory.

I also wish religion hadn't been taken away. This is just personal preference of course, but I found it fun to just take break from everything else for 30-40 turns and crank out a bunch of missionaries to spread Christianity all over the world.

It's not all bad though...there are some good things about Civ 5. Most of the units that could only move one tile per turn in previous games (warriors, archers, etc.) can now move two, so exploration goes a little faster. Also, a single unit now contains multiple persons. So a single archer unit shows as about 10 individual archers, and when they are attacked some of the archers die off. So if your archer unit only has 5 archer persons in it you know right away that it is at half strength.

I also liked the new Social Policies, which allow you to specialize in a certain aspect of culture. For instance, you can specialize in Liberty which gives your civilization growth bonuses due to your now inherently ingrained sense of freedom. There are further ""power-ups"" within the Liberty policy that you can use to enhance the social policy, thus giving your civilization further ""buffs"" in that area.

City States are a nice addition I suppose. They are just single city factions that don't ever expand. You can take them over or befriend them, and if you go with the latter choice they will offer you rewards for your friendship if you nurse them by offering them gifts of gold or protecting them from barbarians. Helping them earns you ""influence"" points with the City State faction, but those points slowly fade away if you don't keep doing things for them.

The opening cinematic is done quite well, but it kind of seems out of place as you don't get any more cinematics throughout the game. Maybe you get to see different cinematics after winning each respective victory condition (cultural, space race, diplomatic, etc.), but I honestly couldn't see myself playing that far in this game.

The user interface is quite simplistic, which I suppose is a good thing for newcomers to the game. However, I found it to cover too much of the screen and it got in my way too often. If there were options to collapse different aspects of the user interface it wouldn't be so bad, but I couldn't find any such options and as such, I felt the user interface for Civ 4 was much cleaner and drastically more useful than in Civ 5, in addition to taking up less space.

Overall Civ 5 is a major disappointment, and I urge anyone who loves Civ 4 or any of the previous iterations of Civilization to stay away from this game. It disappoints on almost every level and the few improvements that were made aren't worth the the annoyances and deficiencies of almost every other aspect of the game. The low quality of the graphics is inexcusable for the year 2010, especially considering the recommended system requirements tout DirectX 10/11 support. The gameplay just simply isn't fun, feels empty and watered down, and you don't even get a printed manual. If you've never played a Civilization game before you might be able to enjoy this one, however I would still recommend that you pick up Civ 4 instead as it provides a much more enjoyable experience.

In addition, this game requires that you install Steam which in turn requires Internet activation. What this really means is that you'll never own this game and will only be able to play it as long as Steam allows you to, all while not guaranteeing the ability to access your games.

* Game mechanics, skill sets, gear enhancement opportunities and build options have all the depth of a damp washcloth. Group mechanics? Nope! Class specific roles? Nada! Class specializations? Nuh-uh! There's only three things you need to remember to be ""good"" in GW2 and those three things are D, P, and S. That's it.

* The AI cheats like no game you have ever seen before.

* PvE so-called commanders try to dictate the activity that takes place on certain PvE maps and there's no shortage of people perfectly willing to be led around by the nose by these people. Fortunately, this sort of thing has dropped off a lot lately. Unfortunately, Arenanet had to remove every champ-level mob from every starter map to stop the stupid level 80s from farming them in a giant loop, demanding that no one else try to take them on until the farming grouped, dubbed the noob train, got there. This resulted in a massive amount of toxicity in chat and a general hatred of one group of players toward another. Not surprisingly, these noob trains were always being led by one of the aforementioned so-called PvE commanders, at least one  of which was actually reporting players for not doing what he (a random nobody) said.

Regardless how how shallow and boring the game is, this ""commander"" stupidity is my biggest beef with this game. It's a pretended authority that anyone can have by simply BUYING the commander status. There's no requirement to being one other than having enough gold to buy the stupid thing and it means absolutely nothing. It isn't like Aion where you have different player ranks that are EARNED and have to be maintained based on your PvP activity and level of involvement in certain major aspects of the game. Nope, it's a status that's based purely on your purchase of it.

Now they even have a free similar status called Mentor that people try to use exactly like the commander status. Everybody gets this for free with the expansion and I like to call the people that use this one ""welfare commanders"".

At any rate, this is a pretty junk game. If you try it, just pick whatever class you like best. It doesn't really matter because the only substantial difference in them is the names of their skills and their animations. Other than that, all the classes and all their skills are essentially identical to each other. Any significant difference is just a facade and the entire game boils down to a max DPS zerg-farming affair.

Back to the Future 2 & 3 (not a game collection by the way, just to let you know) is better in some ways, but way worse in others. On one hand, the overused background music here sounds way better than that 1 and a half second loop of the first game's music. The game also plays better, as it's a hybrid of Mario and Metroid exploration/platforming.

On the other hand, the music is still overused, not making the game seem too great to begin with. And while the game does provide nice platforming, it fails on every bit of exploration. It is never easy to navigate yourself through all of these levels to find the items you need. You're supposed to send the items back to their time periods, but along the way, you'll have to find keys that open doors to items, play crappy bonus stages before reaching the items, unscramble words (Seriously?

I DO remember ESB and ROTJ.  And I certainly remember growing up in that time where THE toys to have were Star Wars related.

My point?  I grew up waiting for a game like SWG.  When it came out in 2003 I was ecstatic and I've been playing it ever since.  Sure, there were always problems with it, but what MMO pleases everyone all the time?  Yet I stuck with it through some very rough spots because I had faith that no matter how bad it got it would always get better.  After all, who could screw up Star Wars?

Well, now I have the answer to that question.  SOE can, apparently.  I played EQ and watched as it devolved into a game for uberleet lewt wh*res, so perhaps I should've seen this coming.  I'm torn whether I'm to blame for my naivete or SOE is for their abominable handling of the Star Wars license.

In the end it doesn't matter.  Because the bottom line is that SOE has absolutely crushed its playerbase with the recent ""Combat Upgrade"".

It used to be that the game economy was player based.  No longer.  Crafters can barely step outside their houses lest they get one-shot killed by a creature that resembles a bunny.  Insert Monty Python joke here, if you please.

It used to be that combatants had some solo content and wouldn't have to spend hours finding and maintaining groups.  No longer.  Soloing in the game is frustrating at best, impossible at worst.

It used to be that the vast majority of equipment worth having was made by player crafters.  And while that may still be true, with every patch and ""upgrade"" it becomes less true as SOE desperately courts those for whom loot is the only thing in the game worth pursuing.

It used to be that patches and upgrades for SWG, while never bug free, at least were given a reasonable amount of time in the Test Center for beta testing.  No longer.  The CU was released with almost no substantive beta testing.  What little beta testing DID exist made utterly no difference, as the feedback from beta testers was completely ignored.

I could go on, but what's the point, really?  The bottom line is that SWG, as it exists now, is a terrible, terrible game.  Buyer beware.  Buyer be-VERY-ware.

1.0,False,"12 9, 2013",AZGQXYB4TAODL,B00GANWVJE,FightForTheLost,"Yet another day and another abysmal Aonuma Zelda is defecated out upon our collective heads.

Where to begin?

Gameplay:

1. Overly easy: challenge free gameplay that makes Celda Wand Wacker Teletubby Island (some erroniously refer to this game as ""Zelda Wind Waker"") gameplay come off like Ninja Gaiden in comparison. Seriously you will NEVER die in this game, not even ONCE, not even if you are a lobotomy patient!

2. Items: No need to possess any actual skill, just go around and hack up some bushes (Eiji Aonuma's favorite gameplay element from LTTP incidentally) and collect enough rupees and you can buy everything that you used to have to search for (in the superior Pre-Aonuma Zelda's ie Zelda 1-4) in order to find. Just pay that stupid Ravio creature for it and you'll get everything from the hookshot to the boomerang with no risk at all to your character's health.

3. Lame gimmick: which turns you into a wall painting, the true purpose of which is not to expand the gameplay elements of the Zelda series in any meaningful way but just another arrogant and obnoxious attempt by Eiji Aonuma to force his disgusting and deformed art style version of Link down our collective throats. The guy simply will not learn his lesson that the Zelda fanbase utterly rejects his chibi art style as well the Saturday morning cartoon presentation for Zelda. In the year 2013 we demand realism NOT sub par dumbed down graphics that appeal to the soccer mom and kintergarten set. We especially desire beautiful epic graphics and sophisticated art styles because we are paying for these expensive overpriced game machines to play these type of games on and we want to see some actual visual performance for our money. In anycase Aonuma doesn't just need to be fired by Nintendo, Nintendo should of never hired him to begin with.

4. Recharge bar: for all the Nintendo fanboy whining about the dominance of the ""dudebro"" first person shooter (FPS) games dominating the world of videogames these days and arguably dumbing it down as a result Eiji Aonuma has ripped off this feature from the Halo series but instead of providing a shield for Link Aonuma has used HIS recharge bar newly added gameplay element to make the game even easier than it already was since now you no longer have to find magic vials or arrows while adventuring out in the world the bar just recharges automatically after you shoot some arrows or use an item such as say the lantern. Seriously Aonuma will not be satisfied until Nintendo allows him to add a dedicated ""win button"" to Zelda.

-Continued pushing of Nintendo's politically correct LGBT agenda by featuring a decidedly homosexual character in a Bunny rabbit suit named Ravio. Ravio is a human character dressed in a bunny suit that helps your character Link throughout the game by offering him various ""tools"" (note the subconscious innuendo there)...Anyway I believe the proper term for this sort of sexual fetish means of dress up role play is called being a ""furry"" if I'm not mistaken? Whatever the case its incredibly sick and inappropriate for children to be exposed to a freak like Ravio in this sort of ""E for everyone"" style game. I'm quite certain Nintendo's featuring of this sick and unsavory degenerate character of Ravio is along the same lines as how the tobacco companies used to use the Joe camel character to push young children into smoking. Well Nintendo obviously wants to encourage young people to become homosexuals which doesn't make any sense since the left generally says such people are born and not made. In anycase creepy and inappropriate character design by Nintendo/Aonuma here and thats not a judgement of being anti gay or even anti furry it is simply a desire for cohesiveness and congruency ie a movie about Martin Luther King Jr. would not be at all served in it's contexual believability by having a white man play the part of Dr. King, likewise homosexual characters and furry fetishists simply do not belong in the context of a midieval sword and sorcery action adventure which The Legend Of Zelda always was, up until the moment that is the untalented hack Eiji Aonuma got involved in it's development. Now much like with society Aonuma has destructively turned Zelda into an ""anything goes"" free for all where trains, robots, homosexuals, furries and other inappropriate set pieces are placed in a game world where they simply do not belong.

-Rehashing Zelda: A Link To the Past's overworld maps in order to try and trick the Zelda fanbase into believing that Zelda is returning to it's glorious form from the past, when really this game is just another Aonuma turd that would've been better off not being made at all.

What Zelda as a series and game franchise desperately needs is Yoshiaki Kozuimi or Takashi Tezuka in the director's chair for it ever as a series to return to health.

To conclude and re-state my own review title over again because its THAT important to say it twice...

This game is a frustrating mess, and the bugs make it unplayable (for multiplayer). Don't do like I did and make this your only launch title or you will be upset. Game would be made much better if people ptfo and they limit the amount of each class (Snipers, and in that case make a seperate class for recon) on the battlefield or did something so players HAVE to contribute to the team. Think the game would improve over all if players couldn't see the k/d and only saw points.

Pro's:

Maps feel fleshed out, not as much sniper fest; more action.

Graphics are much better (duh)

Con's:

Game either cannot connect to servers or will be ""dashboard/reset"" in the middle of a mp match (only happens on mp). This happens repeatedly, makes it very frustrating. GAME BREAKING BUG.

Cannot join others through battlelog

No Squad system like in previous bf games

Cannot customize loadouts from main menu (Can only be done in game or through battlelog on pc or mobile)

When in a Xbox party with other it will automatically send invites when a player in the party joins a game and creates a pop-up on your screen. Super annoying and is accepted with a push of the ""A"" button and rejected with ""B"".

Reviving teammates is glitchy at best, can only be done limited amounts of times, people bleed out faster (have to get there quicker to revive, and only get revived with 20% health. This has in turn effectively reduced the amount of assault troops and their effectiveness. Now most players are playing either recon or engineer.

Lots of spawn and die moments.

Carbines are OP. LMGs are unusable. Snipers (not battle rifles) fire way to fast with pull bolt.

Maps are fun, but don't really feel that different from another (minus each little different levolution event). Locker only map for infantry.

Having said all of that, I still find it to be a somewhat fun game when it is playable. Not as good as bf3 or bc2 in my opinion though.

1.0,True,"07 16, 2014",A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B00E5UHXBK,Erich Hartmann,"This is the worst of the BlazBlue series, and a serious tarnish of my liking for it. I'm actually overwhelmed by how...underwhelming the final product is. It's hard to know where to even begin, but the bottom line is really that it just doesn't make *any* significant changes for the better, anywhere. The story mode has an incredibly slow pace to it, the sprites look terrible when they're zoomed (a new way to present portraits that really doesn't work), the voice-work isn't on-par, the humor misses a lot of the time, and the entire ordeal seems uninspired to a critical extent. It's even, dare I say it, boring. A far, far cry from CT or any iteration of CS.

There are just an astronomical number of little things that add up to destroy this third chapter in the series, but this is the big one: The overhauled gameplay just isn't very good. At all. The mechanics are just not as fun, and for a legitimate reason that at first wasn't clear to me, but then was very clear about 100 matches in. Other reviewers have touched on this, but this is a hard fact: If you want to play this game for multiplayer, don't do it. If you want to play it for single player, it's still questionable.

To keep it simple and clean, regarding the online scene, it's absolutely nothing like its previous iterations--but not for the better, not by a long shot. Online is not much different from a training mode, which I know sounds weird, but it does. It's ultimately nothing more than a mess of rushdowns that are almost completely inescapable and a complete lack of any sort of defensive game (in stark contrast to Persona 4 Arena from ArcSys, which had spot-on mechanics to punish the heck out of rushdowns). There is virtually no defensive game at all, the things that make a fighter ""tactical"" aren't there, the characters have astonishing balance issues, and the online doesn't work nearly as well as it should. Priorities for attacks just don't make sense. The insane focus on the corners (nearly every attack will send you into the corner) and massively-increased emphasis on combos is unsettling when your only defense is often just Bursting. But then it starts over, with rushdown combo after rushdown combo.

But you can't really punish combos. It reminds me of vanilla Injustice: Gods Among Us in a bad way. Blocking doesn't make sense a lot of the time because few characters can get any time to recover and fight back. You end up in the corner literally with every combo your opponent does, and maybe you'll do a combo and do the same--but this isn't what fighting games, or BlazBlue, is about. There is literally no ""spacing"" game, almost no move to maneuver or trick your opponent. Most attacks knock you, or your opponent, apart from each other, so the competition for who can do the longest combo just repeats until one of you is down.

There's so much wrong with the gameplay, it's impossible to go into everything. The ""Overdrive"" system is almost never practical for any reason, and you'll be Bursting way more often--you can't do both, sadly, as they use the same little meter. Because there is no spacing game, throws are totally pointless unless your opponent is a turtle--which doesn't work, anyway, since recovery attacks are almost nonexistent. There's a lot of hidden priorities you have to figure out on your own, which is not fun, and certainly not necessary.

Astral Heats remain next-to-worthless, sadly. They can of course be done, but you'll very rarely see anyone go for it. Most of them are also recycled from the previous games, and the new ones for some characters are pretty underwhelming, even if you do pull them off.

The ""simulated arcade"" idea looks cool at first, but that doesn't work, either. It's frustrating just to think about. You can't challenge people directly, so you basically pick one of the ""cabinets"" and wait. But there are no perimeters to set of any kind. Lobbies for these are all mixed up, so all skill levels exist in these, but that's not a good thing unless you're either very, very good or a total newbie, in which case you'll just be picked on. The chat is full of rude kids and the same things you're used to hearing in any fighting game with a chat. I seriously wonder why they even make a chat at all, since it always is just trolling.

Put aside the atrociously unnecessary DLC of which there is an astonishing amount. The story mode is weak. The overhauled gameplay is no fun to play online, horrendously inaccessible, and is just a massive pool of rushdowns. The new voice-overs are either recycled or aren't particularly interesting. The new characters aren't interesting, either, and the whole series could have pretty much done without them. They don't take away from the game, but they don't exactly add much, either.

So what you ultimately have is an oddly empty, problem-riddled, and tired fighting game. It's like ArcSys just doesn't care anymore. We all knew they were making it up as they went along, that's a given, but it was still entertaining to see what they came up with in all the iterations of CT and CS. It was a system that, above all, worked. Not the case here. This is an alienation of BlazBlue, and not in the good way.

I honestly can't recommend it for anyone, at least not at full price, since the online is so awful. It's fine if you just want to rush through the awkward story mode, but it's not worth $50. If you have my experience, you might not even like the new style of presenting it.

I'll wait a year for the price to come down.  This game is one of the games that I've been waiting to buy.  After reading all the good reviews I was a bit excited at first.  Now that I played a few hours of the game, I think I can give a few comments of the game.

The concept is interesting.  However, the gameplay can be frustrating.  I've never played the first one so I'm not sure if it is relevant to the 2nd Bioshock.

The story itself is intriguing.  The controls of BD make sense.  As I first met with some of the denizens, I realized how difficult the game is.  I think the developers tried to make it real by having Big Daddy to suffer damage easily because of the 50's technology.  For one thing, BD does not have any shield and the health does not regenerate.  A single shot taken by BD can easily take half of BD life.  Two or three shots and I have to start all over from the nearest vita-chamber with the supplies lost.  At some scenes it gets really frustrating - I died at least 10 times before I could get past the stage.  By the time I'm done, I lost all my ammo, fuel and EVE.  Walking around with either is asking for trouble.  At this day and age, I think it is ridiculous to make a game so difficult to play.  I play games to release stress from my daily life.  Games like this really take the fun out of the equation.  While I don't deny there are some good qualities of the game, but making the player really work to get the good qualities is just a little too much.

If you are longing for an addition to the Paper Mario series as similar to PM64 and TYD, you're unfortunately out of luck. While this game by itself is actually decent, it feels no better than an upgraded Sticker Star, and nothing like the original Paper Marios. Comparing to the originals: It's like Mario Kart but instead of Karts, you're riding bicycles. While it's similar, the experience just isn't the same. We need the Karts back..the badges, partners, unique characters and story line back - that's what made Paper Mario, Paper Mario!

If you want a plot that works, make every action depending upon your specific reaction have roughly ten possible outcomes, but then merge them later weave 20 or 30 separate plots depending on what you have done, and that can suddenly shift if you do something really odd, and make the story alter entirely.  Instead Legend of Mana appeared from when I played it to be nothing more than a bunch of loosely strung together garbage- go to a town, solve the puzzle, hear a bunch of drivel that doesn't add up to anything else in your head, get the item and build a new town.  The only thing that was recurring was that the faerie princess kept losing her way from what I played, but what did that have to do with anything.

This is an example of a good nonlinear plot:

You are a child in a town that gets destroyed by an evil overlord. The survivors worship you as the hero and fully expect you to right wrongs and destroy the overlord (base plot).  Now as you set out, you're swinging your sword about like a fool and you kill a cat by accident. You get arrested for animal cruelty, and put in prison.  So then in prison you meet a rogue girl who sets you free, and she tell you that the overlord is small potatoes, that the real problem is this organization that is supposed to be the law but is imposing too harse penalties on minor offenses, so under her tutelage, you become a career criminal.  OR you continue on your way and the overlord send an assassin to poison your drink, but she has a change of heart and drug it instead.  You get sent as a slave to be a gladiator, but you fight well and impress the army and instead fight in a war.  OR you continue unswayed and finally reach the overlord's castle only it seems the townspeople were lying, the guy is really a paladin who saw extreme corruption in the town, and put an end to it, and he has proof. So you march right back tothe town and see that he was right.

This is nonlinear plotline, the plot can make any twist imaginable throughout the game, even sacricing the original antagonize or even the hero.  Assume the hero died in the thief story, the plot might now revolve around the rogue girl, and her adventures.",Hate nonlinear plots... hate em hate em hate em (unless they're done right),1125532800,,,
1.0,False,"04 10, 2001",A2MX1DLIYH2OR1,B00004WI4D,SC,"The basic idea behind the game sounds fun. You're an SAS officer, sent off on a number of missions to save the world. It's a standard FPS shooter, made a bit more exiting by the 3D landscape engine which allows the action to take place across large outdoor environments.
The emphasis is on ""real-world"" fighting - where taking a couple of shots will kill you, and so you spend most of the time creeping around hoping not to be discovered.
There are plenty of gadgets to play with too. The Satelite camera allows you to view the action around you from above, and zoom in on activity in outdoor areas. When you use the camera, the map is shown full-screen and the action caries on around you in ""real-time"". If you're not careful you can get killed while looking at the map.
This ""real-world"" emphasis can be great (try games like SWAT3), but the game designers need to finely balance ""reality"" with ""fun"". Unfortunately this is where Project IGI shoots itself in the foot (as it were).
I couldn't even get past the first level on ""normal"" difficulty. I'm not that bad at games (I've completed Half-life, Star Trek Elite Force etc.), but try as I might I couldn't get through the first mission. I'd get 5 minutes into the level and get shot by a sniper - there's no save game feature, so you have to go back to the start of the level. A boring 5 minutes spent working through the part of the level I'd already completed, shoot the sniper... and then got shot by someone else. Guess what ? Another 5 minutes going back over the exact same level again!
After I'd played through the same part of the same level 10 times I just got bored and went to play something more fun instead.
As far as the rest of the game goes, other than the outdoor maps, there is very little special about the graphics - they're pretty much Quake2 engine standard (sub Half-Life). All that running around, climbing ladders etc. is pretty passe these days (how old is Tomb Raider ?), and there is really nothing new that this game does.
I originally bought the game because PCGamer UK gave it a good review. As it stands, without a save game feature, I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. If Eidos get around to patching the game (there's no sign of it yet), and adding the ability to save your progress within a mission I might start playing it again. As it stands, I'll stick with SWAT3 Elite Edition... ""The element is behind you!"" or Counterstrike.
Pro: 1. The satelite camera is quite cool. 2. Outdoor environments make a change from usual FPS.

When considering buying this product it is IMPORTANT to take into account the products ""FUNCTIONALITY"". This particular version of the game for this platform DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO INSTALL THIS GAME ON YOUR CONSOLE, meaning that you are forced to play this game from the disc. End Notation 4/9/2014

This game was developed on a supposedly ""Heavily modified version of the Source Engine"". The Source Engine has been around a very long time. So has the Xbox360. So everything about the games playability, functionality, load times, latency, lag, unfortunately EVERYTHING about this game has ""forced the buyer"" to suffer from a level of functionality that developers have surpassed years ago.  Bluepoint Games (The game developer responsible for the Xbox360 version) has specifically and intentionally DENIED -->you<-- the ability to install this game upon your Hard Drive. Upon placing the game in the console you are prompted for an update and the option to ""Install"" the game has been removed completely.

GRAPHICS: You can actually enjoy the games graphics for what they are, but they are nothing stellar. Its the same engine that ""Call of Duty"" has been developed on. So if you were in a hospital bed and a doctor needed to determine a ""Baseline"" for graphics youll see throughout the internet that the graphics are just base graphics. There is absolutely nothing stellar about any of the graphics.

CUSTOMIZATION: This game offers the most basic customization. As a matter of fact ""who"" you look like as a foot soldier is determined by which primary weapon you are carrying. Even then, the loadout screen depicts a JPG image of a soldier. The weapons when customizing them are one dimensional JPG images. Basically, there is absolutely nothing customizable about anything other than picking what you want to use, shown to you by a one dimensional JPG image, followed by a one dimensional JPG image of a soldier or Titan, followed by JPG images of weapons in your loadout. All ""flat"" one dimensional images.... similar to when youd pick a character in Street Fighter on the Sega Genesis. So theres no immense development put into weapons nor soldiers nor titans. Very bland,

PLAYABILITY: Ever since this most recent generation of consoles ability to install games it has benefitted not only YOU as a consumer but also those you play with by installing your game onto your consoles HD. I am well BEYOND the standard for any Internet Connection down/up speeds. So its important not to misunderstand when I say that they game forces everything to play WITH LAG, it forces you to HAVE drain on your console, it forces your games ""Frames per second"" to suffer. Why? Because your are now spinning and pulling data off of a game disc. This game suffers from lag, framerate drops, and connection speed issues because the DEVELOPER has forced you to play the game from a disc. In this day and age (last time I was subjected to this poor development of a game) theres no excuse for selling a product with absolutely NO DISCLOSURE of the inability to actually INSTALL the game. Hit registration, jumpy soldier movements, lag, framerate drops, connection issues all slowed down to an abysmal crawl because BLUEPOINT GAMES didn't want you to be able to install the game. Don't buy into this game. Youll have buyers remorse.

Unless you have no standards. If you have no standards by all means waste your money. This game is NOT worth buying a new console for. ""Destiny"" is a game worth a new console. but this no talent azz clown watered down game that forces you to play from a disc isn't worth more than 28 bucks tops.

Buying this game gets you:
-1 day 1 update
-ABSOLUTE Zero customization of soldiers and Titans
-SOLDIER Loadout customization of 3 weapons, a grenade, a boost, and a special ability
-Titan Loadouts of 1 primary, secondary, and an ability
-15 maps... That's it.
-A story mode that is so forgetful its not mentioned above

OVERALL:
This game is the most basic watered down FPS Ive seen within the last decade. More importantly, this game isn't on a Dreamcast, This game isn't on a Sega Genesis, but the developer has insisted on developing this game with functionality so basic that anyone with low standards will be satisfied with this mindless dribble of a game. It literally takes less skill than Call of Duty takes, that's how bad this game is. And being restricted from installing it to your HD just forces the consumer to play this game behind a firewall of LAG AND LATENCY issues. Disgusting development. Poor execution.

1.0,False,"09 30, 2005",A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F,B000809NXC,Mike,"I decided to write this review pretty early, but only because I want to save some people their money. It's not that I hate the game, but it really just doesn't have enough substance to make it a reccomendable purchase.

Somebody has found something to complain about with each RPG Maker. RPG Maker 1 for playstation was excellent, yet people didn't like spending so much time creating games. The game also had some weird problems. Sometimes certain triggers would not work even though I spent hours inspecting them. Still, it was a fun game to play and it looked and sounded great for a 2d game. RPG Maker 2 was way too complicated. I don't mind spending time having to learn alot to play a game, but some things in RPG Maker 2 were ridiculous. If you wanted your attacks to do damage in a battle, you had to make a trigger for your items and a trigger for your items triggers and then an attack trigger. It was a little too advanced. Still, some people had fun with it.

RPG Maker 3 has improved on some old problems. Alot of people complained about having no character portraits, and they put them in this game. Some of them match up with the characters, however 80 % of them do not look like the character models. That is another problem. There aren't that many character models in the game. It is ridiculous as to how few people there are and how many towns I plan on creating. You will see the same people over and over again. Also, alot of those models don't look good for the characters I have in mind. I just want some normal looking adventurers, yet many of the models are too strange looking. Even worse, your party will consist of the most stereotypical characters ever. Personally, I wanted a thief who could carry an axe. HOWEVER! The only male character model that could carry an axe was a dwarf. If I want my guy to carry an axe into battle, he has to be that dwarf model. If I want some dude to carry a sword into battle, he can either look like a gladiator or Charlton Heston from Ben-Hur. To sum this up, the character models are too limited and probably won't appeal to what you like.

Making towns, houses, and field menus is easy. You can create some interesting places pretty simply. Here's the problem with this feature, you can only create so much towns. You can't create an epic RPG because you are limited to how much stuff you can create. Plus, the game takes like 2400 memory. This is the most I have EVER seen on a game. The second highest was grand theft auto for 1100 memory. The game takes 2400 memory per game you create. Memory cards only come with 8000 or so memory. 2400 is ridiculous.

Creating events is like RPG Maker 1. Most of it is easy and it isn't nearly as complicated as RPG Maker 2. The storytelling feature is interesting. You can only create a limited number of storytelling stuff though, so that sucks.

The controls in the game aren't that good. You can only select options in the battle menu with the d-pad. In the terrain editor mode, the d-pad moves too slow, yet the analog stick moves real fast. To look around your character, you can use the right analog stick, yet it doesn't move fast enough. The worst part aobut the control scheme is walking. I shouldn't have to complain about walking, but it is alot like resident evil. You can only move forward and turn around real slowly. If you hold down the analog stick as far as it can go, your character will walk so f'ing slow. In order to sprint, you have to hold the triangle button down. This is AWFUL. It does not feel comfortable to hold triangle down. Besides, the triangle button is pressure sensitive. If you don't press down on it firmly it doesn't work. They screwed up because they made it so that you have to hold it down as far as it will go, otherwise you won't run.

The most striking problem of all... if you don't want to spend money on a keyboard for your playstation, don't even bother buying this game.

Wait, one more problem. Many times in battle when you cast a spell your playstation will have to slow down and load for a second or two. You will notice this and say, ""What the hell? I shot off a fireball and my system had trouble loading?"" It confuses me too, but apparently this game can't even handle it's crappy looking spell animations.

Wait, I found another problem. All the spell animations in the game look stupid. You can barely customize them, and it isn't fun doing that. They should of used RPG Maker 2's spell animation stuff because it was really fun and interesting.

To be honest, this game just isn't worth 50 dollars. It can be good, but it is so limited that eventually you won't care about how beautiful the terrain CAN look. If for 50 dollars you got the game, a keyboard, a memory card(because the game takes up a little over 1/4th of your memory card's memory), a hard-drive(there's a feature to use a hard drive because the game can't load up simple spell animations), and a network card to download people's games online, the game might be worth it.","New game, New problems",1128038400,38,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 2'},

Yeah, some of them can be accessed through the options menu but not the good ones which I've come to love...and the game blows without them.
Secondly, I started playing a francise mode game.  Played a few. Won a few. And, you guessed it...lost a few too.  After a while, like any other normal human being, you get a little weary of playing.  So, the million dollar question...What do you do??  Very good, you save the game.  The next day I decide to go and have another shot at the game, to see if I like it any better than my first impression.  NOPE.  I come to find that my game never saved properly and had to start fresh all over again.  Nice, huh?
Third, the gameplay isn't as fast, or good for that matter.  It isn't as easy to score, the big plays that should don't, and the ones that shouldn't do.  The puck, cpu players, and even your own player don't react as well as the did in 2002.
Next, the game crashed on me a couple of times already.  Not just that, it's slow as hell loading, not as it's booting up, just when you're fooling around with jersey colors or checking out some of the rinks and things of that nature.
I could probably go on and on about my dislikes of the game here but I think most of you will get my point.
In my opinion, THIS GAME [is not good]!  Most games following in a series try to take a couple of steps forward with each new installment.  This one fell back about ten miles....or more.
If you happen to be a really big fan of the series (which I am or was at least) RENT IT FIRST.  Trust me!  You are not going to be pleased.  Otherwise Stick to 2002.  It's a far better game.",The programmers had too many HITZ ...!,1032480000,7,,

To begin I will provide Amazon's customer base the ""tale of the turd"" as I call it in relation to this abomination's ""quality"" or rather lackthereof:

Gameplay: Utterly challengeless. A lobotomy patient, a two year old drooling baby in a feces filled diaper or even an individual with a severe case of down syndrome could easily complete this game in a single sitting with minimal effort. Just mash buttons or ""spam"" the controls as PC gamers would say and you'll eventually complete this atrocious slap in the face Disney level Aonuma dreck.

Graphics: Hideous, vomit inducing, ridiculous, teletubbies-esque, bait and switch from what we were originally promised at Spaceworld 2000 (realistic style epic, cool and beautiful graphics with a decidedly Lord Of The Rings style flare) Also there are ugly and gaudy white lines that appear all throughout Wand Wacker indicating Nintendo was not able to polish this turd before release. Oh what a shame.

Sound: The only redeemable inspiring thing about this Aonuma dud is the ocean music likely composed by Koji Kondo. The rest is detestable Saturday morning cartoon level kiddy drivel. Soccer moms and grandparents should approve. Real Zelda fans can only vomit at this level of disrespect Nintendo has stooped to in order to insult us.

Theme: Near total rip off of Kevin Costner's Water World to such a great extent I fully believe Costner could probably win a lawsuit against Nintendo for royalties if he so desired. Needless to say this watery environment is not what true Zelda fans look forward to when we go to pick up a new Zelda game. No, what we're looking for is the green forests and fields of Hyrule proper, not some watery grave that sits atop it for reasons likely relating to Aonuma's child learning how to bathe for the first time and Aonuma getting inspired to make Zelda into a giant bathing simulator via Wand Wacker. I've said it before and I'll say it again Nintendo needs to fire Eiji Aonuma and his entire Zelda team and get normal people developing the Zelda series again for it to return to health.

Commentary: The online game journalists also known as professional liars can attempt to re-write history all they like but The Legend Of Celda: Wand Wacker will go down as the most hated videogame of all time and the greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history.

This was Nintendo, Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma's Vince Mcmahon esque ""Screw you!"" to the true Zelda fanbase and by true Zelda fanbase I'm not referring to the scumbag sycophants that populate online gaming message forums but the market in general who determines whether videogames become massive successes or massive failures and the true Zelda fans spoke loud and clear not once but twice.

Two whole times on that Wand Wacker piece of dog excrement first with its original Gamecube release and second with its Wii U HD re-release that this is not the way that they envisioned the Legend Of Zelda series, this is not the way they wanted it to go and as a result Wand Wacker flopped mightily BOTH times as such a Benedict Arnold or Rosenbergs esque betrayal is destined to do.

To rephrase a quote from Ridley Scott's Gladiator: ""Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Zelda and this is not it, THIS IS NOT IT!""

We were lied to and led to believe that the epic, cool, badass, Spaceworld 2000 realistically presented Zelda would be what we would soon be getting on the Gamecube but then much later the bait and switch hideously deformed Celda Wand Wacker made its debut to boos and hisses worldwide and massive hate on the internet was poured it and Nintendo's way (before the damage control brainwashing took effect which has left a dishonest internet forum gaming community in its wake who pretends to love Wand Wacker in order to shill and run damage control for Nintendo while real Zelda fans have abandoned Nintendo due to its betrayal of them for the other consoles or PC gaming if they haven't simply upped and left gaming in disgusting over this nasty unnecessary debacle and betrayal of Zelda's true fans.

Eiji Aonuma the hack no talent Jimmy Fallon Of Japan enabled by the out of touch Shigeru Miyamoto has been ruining the Zelda series since he took up its reigns to create the embarrassment known as Majora's Mask.

Aonuma's first game ""Marvelous"" failed (MARVELOUSLY!) and he had no credentials at all to be given the Zelda series but insanely Nintendo gave it to him and ever since he's been driving Zelda along with it's sales figures into the ground making one boring puzzle filled bad NPC filled faux Zelda game after another.

When the truth of the matter is Zelda is supposed to be an arcade action adventure sword and sorcery game with light RPG elements thrown in for good measure.

Aonuma completely butchers this formula in favor of the boring garbage gameplay elements he prefers and the market lets him know what it thinks of his efforts by making sure his version of Zelda ends up in the bomba discount gaming bins where such low quality trash belongs.

In anycase to re-iterate so as to set this very important point in stone once more:
Wand Wacker offers up literally no gameplay challenge whatsoever and can be completed by a lobotomy patient (as is typical of Aonuma offerings).

I know what you're saying; ""What the... are you crazy?  Unpatriotic?""  Yes, I said unpatriotic.

The original Half Life was set in the middle of the American mid-west, at a deep underground US government facility.  This latest game is set somewhere in Europe, and gives us a multi-ethnic love interest.  The love interest isn't bad in and of itself, and it really doesn't matter what race she is, so put your racist accusations away.  What I'm getting at is the fact that all of the game's contents are marketed not as an American product, but as one for a ""global community"".

To me that's a stab in the back.  It's subversive with good intentions, but still underhanded, and dilutes everything for which my nation created and stood for.  Let Gordon be Gordon, and let the game's love interest be whatever race, creed or nationality the can be.  Just put the damn thing back in the US of A.

What does this have to do with Half Life 2?  Well, how come we don't see US Special Forces trying to interfere again?  Suddenly the ""G-Man"" isn't some US secret service agent, but just some mysterious jerk.  Suddenly the American flag isn't posted anywhere.  Suddenly we're not in the US anymore, but in some European setting?

What the hell?

In an attempt to make commercial art viable for international markets, national identities and ethnicities are stripped.  Note how Gordon Freeman went from being a white MIT grad to a ambiguously ethnic scientist.  Again, put your racist label away, because what I'm wondering is why if there's such a concern over making this game marketable, why tinker with the game's foundations?

The graphics are sexy, as is the sound, and the story, for what it is, is okay.  But I still don't like it.  I want the Gordon Freeman and facility I bought in the late 90's brought back to life.  It's not going to happen.  It never will.  The G-# of nations have built their new social dynamic, and, unfortunately, it means pirating American culture and thought, and giving it to the world.

*Sigh* Where to begin...

This game could be better named:

""Star Wars Galaxies: A Development Team Vs. A Player base"".

Never in all my life, have I seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's truly sickening. I WAS a 20-month veteran of the game, I had been playing since week one (I've canceled my account and will NEVER do business with SOE again!).

PLEASE, READ ON...

In the beginning...

This game was alright; it was fun, it was unique, and it was totally bug-ridden and unbalanced. Over the course of the last 20 months, the SOE Dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game. They in fact did very little, if anything at all. They milked us. They exploited the ""Star Wars"" name to make a buck. They made promise after promise after promise... and never delivered squat. Don't believe me? Just ask any ""Smuggler"" in the game for their opinion.

They strung us along and led us to believe that the ""fixes"" to the game were right around the corner! Instead, they were hard at work on an ""Expansion Pack"" to sell us! And then once again ""promised us"" that the fixes we've all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us, ""just hang on, this game is going to be great!"" They promised us that they were going to do this ""Combat Upgrade"" and do it right, and it ""wouldn't be released until it's ready!""

We all had a lot of hope, we thought that they had finally figure out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse. God, how wrong we all were...

Well, much to everyone's surprise, they made the announcement that the long awaited ""CU"" would be coming out along with the ""Rage of the Wookiees"" expansion pack! Uhhhmmm... did I miss something somewhere? The alpha test for the ""CU"" was supposed to begin in January, it never happened. Beta testing began in April, 4 whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live! We all rolled up our sleeves and dove in. I think after the first week or so, the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink in...

They went and copy/pasted EQ2 code into the SWG game so they could ""streamline"" their operation by having ONE DEV TEAM WORK ON BOTH SWG AND EQ2!!!

The CU was supposed to go live on May 5th. SOE decided to push it to live a whole 2 weeks sooner than that. Honestly, with all the bugs that were still in beta, and now in live, beta could have gone on another 4-6 months! I guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it. Why am I not surprised?

The CU itself is unplayable. It has become Everquest in space, or ""EverStar Galaxies QuestWars"" as we call it. There are just too many things to list. There are a lot of other more technical reviews which go into much more detail over on the page for the stand-alone game.

As you all can imagine, the player community was totally enraged! We went to the SWG Forum boards to voice our concerns. The only response we ever got back from SOE was THOUSANDS of deleted threads and players banned from the forums. Facing futility, a large portion of the player base has left the game, permanently this time.

This is just not how you do business. I personally will NEVER deal with Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) EVER again. I DO NOT pay MY HARD EARNED MONEY to be lied to, deceived, ignored, strung along, censored, and banned for voicing my concerns. I do not pay money to folks who treat me, a PAYING CUSTOMER, in this fashion.

Star Wars Galaxies is dead. Servers are emptying. People are moving on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons. If you are a fan of Star Wars, and this is the only reason I ever started playing this game to begin with, you will be sadly disappointed!

SWG is nothing more than an exploit of a title, a milk machine. I for one, am tired of being milked.

The reason why I called my review Heavenly cannonballs, is because this was the biggest most dissappointing thing for me in the game. I thought there were too many sequences in this game where you had to steer objects with the controller. There is practically as much or more of this horrible gameplay mechanic you have to deal with in the game than there is hacking and slashing, and the game is short enough already!

I am not new when it comes to hack and slash games (they aren't my favorite), but this one was just so completely disappointing. When I got to the last boss, I couldn't take it anymore.. after 11 tries I quit, took the disc out of my ps3, and gave it away to a friend immediately without even beating it. The same friend told me it took him 3 months to beat the final boss on God of War when I complained about the difficulty. Question: How is that even remotely fun? It shouldn't take more than a week to beat a non-rpg single player game in my opinion. Anything beyond that, unless the game is extremely long, is just frustrating and unpleasant. Its like watching a long movie, that takes all the wrong turns when you wish it would take a right one.

I walked out of G.I. Joe because it was a horrible movie. I gave this game away before beating it for the same reason.. HORRIBLE. This game is overrated, and I feel like I completely wasted my time, energy, and money on it. I will not allow this game into my PS3, let alone my home ever again.

3 star = Playable and fun game, I would recommend it but there may be a better alternative (a game that received a 4 star in the same genre)

2 star = Not worth playing. No need to purchase. Much better games out there in the same genre.

1 star = Silly game. A waste of time. No need to bother.

And now we can continue with the actual review for Wii Sports ... First of all, I am a 24 year old male. I am not happy seeing a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews for this game. Its as if no other games were played therefore the reviewers had nothing to compare the game to. I can understand that as Wii Sports comes with a new Nintendo Wii. This is not a hot launch title like Super Mario 64 was for the N64. In no way should this game have the same review rating as Super Mario 64. I would give this game a 1.5 as it is 5 games in one but ratings need to be lowered! As to not fool anybody out there that this is a hot product, because it is NOT. I am one that relies on Amazon reviews for a lot of the products I buy. So I do not want to be misinformed. People who purchase the Nintendo Wii spend their time playing hot titles like Zelda, Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3, Resident Evil 4, Mariokart Wii, etc. THIS GAME, ""Wii Sports"" can be seen left in its packaging unopened by a Wii owner. If I could sell this game I'd be happy. If you purchase a Wii that does not have Wii Sports, please purchase a different game. As I'm sure you can always borrow this from a friend. In fact, they may very well give it to you. I would.

So lets look at this game ... The title of this review is ""too much intrinsic ratings"". What I mean by this is the high ratings are given to this game because it has a strong relationship with the Nintendo Wii console. Nintendo Wii is of great success (and even having this Wii Sports game included with it, I would still offer 5 stars to Nintendo Wii). But this individual game needs to be reviewed for the game that it is. And not a psychological view that 1) it is mutual with the Nintendo Wii (dont want to give a bad review to the game that piggybacks with a remarkable console), or 2) it is often the first game played on the Nintendo Wii. In fact being the most handed out game (how often are hand outs considered popular?) this game has only received less than 20 reviews. Maybe its because hardcore gamers have no interest in this game, or never bothered to play it. As I had no intention playing this game when I purchased my first Nintendo Wii.

So lets look at what it offers ... these are all short games. Nothing competitive, or innovative. An introduction as other reviewers have mentioned. This is more like a demo. Or a tutorial for the real version of the games. And is very PONGY.

Baseball ... only 3 innings. Cant play defense. Use no thought. You just pitch, and bat. While the computer plays the fielders. No double plays can be made, no pick-offs. I consider it an 80's baseball version of pong. It is very simplicit. What I mean by this is when you hit the ball, as soon as the fielder touches it, it will tell you whether you received a single, a double, or a triple. Can you imagine playing a baseball game on an 80's computer? Where it tells you what happens. Yes, like that. You don't tell the runners where to go or have ANY interaction with the fielders. Its very basic. Pitch the ball by swinging down. Then hit the ball by swinging across. And thats IT. Let the computer take care of the rest. No buttons need to be pushed in this game.

Tennis ... this game reminded me when I was in Las Vegas. I played a game called ""Ace Tennis"" on one of those virtual game touch-screen machines at a bar. Again, its very simple, just swing the remote at the right time. Doesnt take any thought. The ball seems to always go over the net and land in the same spot everytime. You can do this with your eyes closed. And not to mention but when playing single player, you play on a team of two. I played best out of 5 games, and best out of 3 games, the player on my team NEVER hit the ball. He was just a stand in, I did all the work. The same was true on the opponents team, he just slid back and forth along the net, didn't do anything unless I hit a slow one just over the net. And he'll finally pong it back to me. I literally spent 5 minutes going back and forth with the tennis ball. Just same ol same ol. Opponent doesnt make mistakes (he did once though I'll admit so consider it rare).

Boxing ... first day I got my Wii (I had no other games) I couldn't sleep that night. So I got up at 1:30am. Didnt have anything to do at the computer so I played Wii Sports. I had played Wii Sports for over an hour earlier that day to get used to the game. It was kind of fun at first cause you're learning the game and wondering if this really is that 4+ star game!! ... so I get up at 1:30am and I really didn't want to play it but I had no choice lol. I searched through the game TRYING to find a reason to like it but I couldnt. Boxing is probably my favorite sport here. I spent an hour boxing. It gets harder after each fight you win. Eventually after an hour you get frustrated cause you cant get any punches through and it tires you out. The controls are a little tricky too. Punches I wanted to do would rarely register (the low or side punches). You can literally win rounds with nothing but high punches (which is keeping the remotes in front of your head and swinging down as if you're beating a drum). That simple. But the only reason I liked the boxing is cause it was a nice workout for the arms. After an hour you will feel a light sweat, become a little tired, you feel the blood pumping through your arm. So boxing is something I can consider apart of a workout plan. But there could be a much better option like Wii Fit, or a more in-depth boxing game like Facebreaker for example. In fact the mini games on Rayman Raving Rabbids gave me a better workout when I was beating a drum listening to a song. It made me move my body as I rhythm'd to the beat.

Golf ... frustrating. I'm not a golf fan myself. This isn't Tiger Woods here, you cant customize, or play in competitive championships. Im sure Carnival games: MiniGolf is a much better option. Brings you more into the game. This golf here is very basic. You hit the ball in the hole, try to make par, and then you do it again lol. Very ""pong-y""

Bowling ... bowling was hard for me. I didn't really master it. I had fun when I first played. Though having been without a game console for 6 months I was quite eager to play a Nintendo Wii again so I was thrilled no matter what I played =)

And that sums up my review. This is a very PONGY game, as in basic / beginner / tutorial / demo. Its not your top of the line sport game here. I really hope this isn't viewed as a remarkable game for the Wii. I think the future of gaming has yet to come, Nintendo Wii being apart of that future and this game is just not it. Its pong. And you sure don't want to spend $30? on this game. Wow. I think the market is overpriced on that. Especially with so many in production it will greatly drop in value with time. I personally might play this game again. As I mentioned, boxing is a light workout. And Tennis is a virtual game I played at a bar having some drinks. So I wouldnt mind re-living that memory. And thats about it. Dont give yourself high expectations for this game coming from an adult perspective. For your child, they'll find more fun to it but still better alternatives for them ===",Very PONGY game. Too many intrinsic ratings!,1228694400,10,,

I went so far as to pre-order the game on Steam and now wish I could get a refund.

The ONLY good thing about this game is that the whole thing can be beaten in under 5 hours (less if not for the bugs). According to Steam, I played this game for 7 hours so far and have had 4 crashes, as well as encountering literally countless bugs, the best of which was doors NOT OPENING, or getting STUCK in the environment - forcing me to reload multiple times... Yeah. No idea how this made it past quality assurance... Way to go Gearbox, way to go.

But honestly, the bugs aren't even the worst part. What makes this game so terribly boring is that it feels like an on rails light gun game, with terrible and uninteresting level design (there are some exceptions to this). Why an Aliens game has such limiting environments is beyond my understanding. Invisible walls and missing textures also serve to bring down the little immersion that some of the better designed areas bring to the table.

The enemy AI is absolute garbage and allows you to easily blast one Xeno after another as they calmly walk in front of your shotgun (or get glitched in the environment and just stand there). Getting hit in ACM by an alien is virtually impossible.
Eventually you also get to fight some humans, but nothing changes. You can still Rambo your way through everything using your trusty shotgun with what feels like unlimited ammunition and pinpoint precision.
Next up is the AI of your squad mates, and wow... It is not uncommon to see someone glitched in the environment or running around in circles during a firefight. You simply can't make stuff like this up!
All in all this game has the absolutely worst AI I have seen in recent releases, which is even more disappointing seeing as how Gearbox promised us ""incredibly advanced AI"".

Gameplay doesn't fare any better. At one point you are forced into a stealth level and a few Work Loader sequences. That's it. And they are all as bad as the rest of the game. There is NOTHING new or even marginally exciting in Aliens: Colonial Marines. In fact, it makes the disaster that was Duke Nukem Forever seem like a masterpiece. I also don't understand what happened to ACM's graphics and animations. A few of the older demo videos of ""actual gameplay"" that Gearbox was showing off look much better than the retail game does on my (almost) top of the line gaming machine. Even on the highest settings this game looks like Doom 3, which looked good when it came out years ago - but has not aged too well in the graphic department. For some reason ACM also animates much worse than D3 - the animations seem stiff and forced.

Even if I could forgive all of the above, the story is terrible (even more so considering that this is supposed to be the sequel to the films), complete with COUNTLESS plot holes, and ""WTH"" moments. Without giving anything away, dead characters are brought back to life with no explanation, and areas that have been nuked are now back in perfectly serviceable conditions (once again with no explanation).

I suggest that you stay away unless you can get the game for around $10, since in its current state that is all ACM is honestly worth.
I am currently working with Steam to try and get my money back due to all the false advertising Gearbox did before the game released (links in the comments section).

Only 1yr for the 2 red lights, supposed 'overheating' fault, which I eventually got during a 10min game session and continue to get every once in a while. Even still with the warranty you have to send your system in to get it repaired or replaced with a refurbished system, which takes about a month to get resolved.

Squad AI and enemy AI: This basically kills the game. The squad AI is so bad, the squad is a liability rather than an asset. Squad members will run out in front of you and block your shot, refuse to stay put when you tell them too, refuse to maintain distance and will therefore attract splash damage to you because they run up next to you, stand out in the open and just shoot away. The way the controls are set up, squad-mates are unnecessarily hard to issue orders to. For example, the game forces you to use a 'Biotic' power to destroy certain enemies. If you're a soldier you don't have access to these powers, so you have to use a squad-mate. To do so, you must have line of sight to the enemy that you want your squad-mate to destroy. WHY? How does this make any sense whatsoever? Why not just let the player switch control between characters like most RPGs of the 'recruit your squad-mates' variety do? Enemy AI is very primitive. While they us cover, it's very sparingly and they never do anything other than hold position or duck and weave between different cover. No grenade usage, no assault, nothing. BORING!
Sticky walls: ME1 decided to go with the '3rd person shooter duck and lean' system popularized by Gears of War. While it may work well on a console, here it's just annoying - you repeatedly stick to any bit of wall that you run into and un-sticking yourself is not smooth but you sort of have to pull yourself away. It's very annoying.
The Car & Mineral Collection: It's no fun to drive (in fact, it drives terribly and is very very aggravating) and they turn resource collection into a boring drive across empty terrain. If you don't do this, you can't buy the good stuff. So you just have to explore scores of worlds, driving across maps to find minerals. It's all very irritating and boring after the first time. The fact that this has to be done many many times made me decide to drop the game and stop playing it.
The BIOWARE recipe: Here's how it works - reveal a terrible calamity to the player. Have him move around the world collecting companions and harvesting resources by giving him boring, semi generic missions (the missions are basically identical between games. Try playing Dragon Age & KOTOR 1 alongside ME1 and you'll see what I mean). When he becomes Uber Powerful, lock him into a channeled sequence of events which culminates in him killing the boss in a (usually boring and repetitive shoot out so many body parts type) boss fight. We went there and did that with KOTOR 1 & 2, Dragon Age 1 & 2 and I hope by now people realize just how absolutely standardized all Bioware games are and how ME 1 stays true to this generic pattern.

1.0,False,"02 16, 2012",AB0KXC2NVTQ5F,B002BSC4ZS,Al-Nabati,"Metroid has got to be my favorite series of all time:  non-linear exploration, epic battles, and superbly entertaining weapons and power-ups which you get both by following the story line and by NOT following it at all.  No matter what you did, you were either going to be entertained by challenging fights, challenging puzzles, or just the sheer joy of exploration.  You were always alone, but it was alright--Samus just seemed so unflinching.

Those days are gone, possibly for good if Nintendo allows for the next Metroid game (if there will be one) to follow this one's design.  You aren't allowed to explore at will anymore, the storyline is bent out of shape, the controls are annoying, the voice acting is bad, and Samus is unrealistically vulnerable as a character.

On the Metroid timeline this story falls right after Super Metroid--Zebes is destroyed, along with the last Space Pirate stronghold, not to mention the last Metroids.  After so many years of fighting the Pirates Samus is seemingly left without a cause and begins to resume her old life as a bounty hunter when she picks up a distress signal coming from a remote space station; she decides to investigate and finds that the station she lands on is teeming with dangerous life forms, and the only other humans are a small squad of Federation soldiers.  But not just any soldiers, because two of them used to fight with Samus when she was part of the Army:  Anthony Higgins and Adam Malkovich.  Malkovich was her commanding officer, and this is the precept for just about every cinematic sequence of the game.

Unfortunately, this is also the first problem with the game.  Of the time spent playing your are going to have several hours of mandatory, non-skippable cinemas.  So instead of providing you with a game which has in depth gameplay AND an in depth cinematic, you have to watch movie after movie after movie.  The point of this game comes off as being more about Samus's relationship with her previous teammates than the current investigation of the death of almost every human aboard the space station.

This doesn't sound too terribly bad, to be honest, because Samus is a character who has been shrouded in mystery pretty much since day one.  It's only natural that we would want to get to know her a little more personally, but unfortunately this ruins the dynamic of a Metroid style game because if you have to pursue the storyline as the movies dictate the joy of exploration just isn't there.  You're meant to find everything you find, to get every power-up you get; your effort (the player's effort) is actually quite minimal.  There's no element of puzzle-solving at all in this game, which is another major departure from the rest of the series.  If you see a door that you can't yet open (because you don't have the right power-up) you aren't allowed to backtrack to open it up after you do have the right power-up unless that area is where the story requires you to be.  And I mean it when I say that you aren't allowed to backtrack--certain doors will be locked (even if you've been through them before) depending on where you are in the story and will not open again until much later.  The designers of the game talked about 'the joy of discovery' in this game; ironically you aren't allowed to discover anything they don't want you to discover.

As mentioned, this rigid gameplay is linked to the story, which as a story only sort-of works.  Yes, it's good to get a deeper glimpse of Samus's past, but to make the game focus almost entirely on the past makes things a little less enjoyable.  Especially when you consider that as story lines get more and more complex, and that the tradition in Metroid is to start out with nothing and build your way up, you need an explanation for why Samus doesn't have her full range of gear at the start.  In this game you are denied use of your gear in the beginning on grounds that you are working with other troops and that stray fire from your much more powerful weapons could kill someone; if you need something more intense Malkovich (being the CO) will authorize it.  Sounds logical, until you consider that there are items in Samus's arsenal that wouldn't hurt anyone.  Like the Varia Suit, for example; all it does is reduce damage from enemies and protect Samus from temperature extremes.  Yet there is a part in the game where you have to run through a super-heated area, taking damage from both the heat and the enemies all at the same time, while Malkovich refuses to let you turn on your Varia suit feature.  You're getting cooked to death, which Malkovich knows, but he refuses to let you save yourself.  The same thing goes for the Gravity Suit and the Space Jump--both are perfectly harmless, but you're not allowed to use them because Malkovich says no.  (This in itself is also a huge departure and very un-Samus-like, as Samus usually just does whatever she wants.)  And to make the irony complete, you spend most of your time alone.  No other soldiers to endanger nearby...  Lots of large and dangerous creatures everywhere...  But still no plasma beam...

The controls were (largely) designed to work like the classic SNES controls as this game takes a third person perspective.  You hold the remote horizontally and use the d-pad and a couple of buttons for the majority of the game.  But, the game producers forgot that the gaming world is largely in 3D now so a little directional pad with only four directions doesn't quite let you do everything you need to do.  Like walking diagonally, for example.  Or dodging enemies.  To be fair, the designers tried to introduce a Matrix-style dodging technique complete with special killing blows, all of which sounds cool and sounds classic considering how Samus would always be doing multiple flips in mid-air and jumping off walls in the older 2-D games.  But in this game the Matrix-style moves are not an option, they are a requirement.  Some enemies take a very long time to kill without these killing blows, and because this is a 3D game every time you try to dodge you are going to be facing the wrong direction.  This is because the dodging is all done on the D-Pad which is also how you move and change direction.  That's right, you have to press the D-Pad in the right direction at the right moment to dodge because walking won't get you out of the line of fire fast enough.  You can still change directions during these dodges, which means that if you do so unintentionally (very easy with a d-pad) you will not be facing your enemy, a big problem if you intend on actually killing your enemy quickly.  Don't rely on the auto-targeting either; because the game is 3D with 2D controls the designers included an auto-aim feature, which doesn't always do the logical thing (target the closest enemy you are facing).  You'll be doing more dodging than you really want to.  What's worse, there is no control to allow you to center the camera behind Samus--you will be ambushed because of that and you will take a lot of damage because of that ambushing.

To be brief about the voice acting, the narrations are bland and the lines for the cutscenes are not at all what you would expect from a bounty hunter who has just spent the past few years helping the war effort, and had spent many years before that on her own as a bounty hunter.  You would expect Samus to be blunt, terse or maybe even rude.  Instead she is quiet and unnaturally polite, not to mention verbose.  Not what you would expect from someone whose CO basically let her burn on the station rather than turn on her temperature protection suit...

Which brings us to Samus as a character.  As mentioned we would expect Samus to be tough and more than willing to bend the rules if she thinks she needs to because that' what she did in almost every other game.  But for the duration of the game, Samus just does whatever Malkovich asks; most of the cinemas (remember that they are usually 20 minutes or longer, and you can't skip) become soap operas of Samus's past.  Samus is depicted as being sensitive in this game, which is normal for a human being but her sensitivity is so extreme that it gets in the way--literally.  At one point she confronts Ridley and goes into a panic attack that prevents her from fighting.  But any Metroid fan will remember that by this point in the Metroid timeline Samus has fought Ridley a grand total of five (5) times without panicking in the slightest...  Why this time, I don't know.  It makes no sense, and the warrior who has always managed to conquer her fears in the face of death suddenly can't fight back...  I'm sorry, but the designers destroyed Samus as a character.  To be emotional is normal, but if you can be reduced to a crying, blubbering mass instantly odds are you aren't a bounty hunter who has just spent the past few years in the middle of a war.

Samus is also unrealistic physically, which of course leads to sexploitation.  Everyone who has ever seen gameplay scenes from a Metroid game would have to admit that Samus is extremely athletic, almost gymnastically so.  In this game, however, there are numerous cutscenes of Samus in her Zero-Suit (so form fitting that it might as well be called a birthday suit) and you can tell she's very well... endowed around the waist and the bosom.  Compare that to a real athletic woman (especially a gymnast) and you will know that something is wrong; there is no justification for her physical design as a character, and you have to ask yourself why the programmers designed her this way.  Considering her figure and just how tight her suit I am tempted to say her design borders on the pornographic.  I would definitely urge parents to think twice before letting their children play this game.  Samus is not a warrior in this game, she's a pin-up girl.

In many ways Samus is the game, and in this game she just is not believable.  She's not the tough, independent character we expect given her circumstances and personal history, she's a submissive quasi-crybaby.  Furthermore, giving her long monologues and cutscenes was a big risk on the part of the game designers, one that did not pay off; they not only damaged her character but damaged the genre altogether.  Keeping Samus quiet in the other titles let you feel involved; you didn't just control Samus, you were Samus.  That was why Metroid was always so much fun.  But in this game, you're not Samus anymore.  Instead you're just watching her, usually in cutscenes that go on and on.  There isn't much fun in cutscenes, which is why most serious gamers skip each and every one.",NOPE.,1329350400,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

They also had to lower the graphics by A LOT to get it to do 1080p and 60fps. If you compare video of it at E3 when it was obviously running on a high powered PC, compared to the version we got on Xbone. It's just sad. They removed buildings, lowered texture quality, removed a lot of shadows and light effects. They tuned down everything to get it to run at those stats. I would have preferred a 480p game if it would mean they could have left all the other stuff in. Just a terrible excuse of a game.

1.0,True,"10 22, 2011",A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B001SGZL2W,Caraculiambro,"I was looking forward to this game but found myself only lukewarm to it after the first few days of play.  After that, though, indifference gave way to fury.

These are not in any particular order -- except the first, which brought my game to a halt:

1.  First of all, I hope you think gambling in a video game is fun.  I don't.  I played this game for about five days until I got to this point where you have to play something called ""Liar's Dice"" to continue.  Quite apart from the fact that I find gambling idiotic and gambling in a video game silly in particular, I couldn't figure out this mini-game and couldn't win at all, which one has to do to advance the plot.  Hence I could not advance the plot and the game came to an end.  There was no way to continue.  I tried everything.  I tried shooting the guy who deals the dice.  No luck:  he simply respawns.  I tried buying the classy suit that allows you to cheat.  Doesn't help.  There was simply no way to move this game forward and therefore we were unable to finish it.  I found it absolutely beyond belief that Rockstar Games, a multimillion-dollar publisher of mainstream video games, would have authorized the idiotic decision to have one of their showcase titles completely held up while the player learns and wins this absurd mini-game.  After three straight days of playing the idiotic ""Liar's Dice,"" we (neither I nor any member of my family) was able to win a single round.  Thus we couldn't continue with the game and finish all the missions.  After that, the game went back in the closet.  Uh . . . who is making these decisions at Rockstar games?

2.  I've hated video games before, but at least I understood what was going on.  This, though, would have to be the first video game that I spent confused the entire time.  You're riding along, minding your own business, and suddenly a blue dot appears on your mini-map and somebody asks for help:  ""They stole my horse,"" etc.  The problem is, no sooner do you dismount than suddenly 5 red dots appear around you and shoot you to death.  Wait, what?  What happened?  Who's shooting me?  Why wasn't I given a second to ready myself?  Alternatively, 6 red dots appear out of nowhere and begin shooting at you for no discernible reason.  These sorts of challenges (I think the game calls them ""unattached criminals"") were extremely poorly done.  There's another one that is fairly typical of the way the game works:  you're walking through town.  Somebody approaches and says, ""Hey, my horse was stolen!""  You whistle for your horse, mount it, ride towards the indicated dot for about a second before it says, ""You let the thief get away,"" or ""You failed to catch the thief.""  Although you weren't really allowed to chase him down to begin with.  With most of these challenges, there's simply no way to win.  Additionally, it's not clear why challenges reappear.  Did you not do it right the first time?  For example, I can't count how many times I had to clear the bandits out of ""Pike's Basin.""  Was I failing it in some way?  It said ""complete"" (or at least I thought so), but as soon as I cut through the basin again, lo! the bandits had all repopulated and the farmer needed help again.  This was puzzling:  is this simply an eternal challenge that you can always do when you need cash or was I leaving something undone?

3.  The visual style of this game recalls the Sergio Leone films, and I was hoping it would be a gritty exploration of the seamier side of the Western myth.  But a lot of this game has you shooting rabbits and picking flowers!  This is absurd!  I'm playing this game to play a tough cowboy who gets to shoot bandits and so forth.  If I wanted to roam through the desert looking for flowers, I wouldn't need a video game for that!  In addition, picking flowers is a sissy activity that my manly cowboy wouldn't be seen doing!  Also, skinning armadillos and horses?  Am I the only one who finds this degrading?  If the game was going for realism, then why did it give me a magical map?  And a magical horse?

4.  Traveling to distant places was a frustrating hassle.  Sure, there's a fast-travel system, but why was it so complicated?  Why do I have to leave town to fast-travel?  I can understand not being able to fast-travel in the middle of a mission, but why can't I fast travel from my hotel room, or anywhere else for that matter?  Sheesh!  I got the feeling that, in the early drafts of the video game, you WERE able to fast-travel anywhere from anywhere, as is logical, but at some point some supervisor pointed out that if players were able to do this, they'd finish the game too quickly.  Hence the fast-travel system was deliberately made more complicated so as to drag out the game.  ""You need a better spot for your campsite.""  Why?  All the bandits are dead, plus this town loves me!  Why can't I save here and now?  Who cares if it's close to the water?  And why do I have to be subjected to that intolerable animation of me kicking out the campfire?!  I've seen it a zillion times!  Skip it!  It's not even the loading screen!  It's just some stupid animation that you have no choice but to put up with.

5.  There are no difficulty levels in this game, at least in the PS3 version.  Some of the missions are really hard (or confusing) and you're not in the mood.  Tough luck! Everything must be completed on full difficulty.  Someone told me this game was constructed so that if you fail a mission, it gets easier and easier until you pass it.  I don't know how that rumor got started, but I can confirm it's not true.

6.  You cannot skip missions if you find them distasteful.  WARNING:  Do not play this in front of your family.

7.  On the other hand, there's no way to replay missions if you liked them -- without replaying the entire game.

8.  There is a problem with my cowboy's vision.  The enemies can see him from a million miles away, but there's no way for you to see them.  If they're hidden against, say, dark bushes, there's no way to zoom in and really see what it is you're looking at until you see the puff of smoke that indicates they've shot at you.  Meanwhile, they have no problems seeing you clearly from long distances with complete accuracy.

9.  Your enemies have line of sight to you when you're behind cover and their bullets can often hit you through what are supposed to be solid obstructions, such as adobe walls.  Meanwhile, your bullets cannot pierce solid obstructions and hit them while they're taking cover.

10.  This is one of those cursed video games that thinks it's cool not to give you a health meters but instead start to splatter the screen with blood when you start to get damaged.  Why are video game manufacturers doing this these days?  It's such an inferior system.  The upshot is that you don't know how much health you have!

11.  The story setup is fairly good:  the federal government has strong-armed you into bringing back a famous bandit.  Fine.  But then several missions have me getting involved with characters that would be out-of-character for me to get involved with, much less help.  Seth, the guy who digs up coffins?  I wouldn't have gotten involved with him.  The doctor that sold elixirs?  I wouldn't have gotten involved with him.  The gamemakers made much of the fact that they are supposedly giving you a full world to explore, but the reality is that they railroad your characters majors decisions at nearly every point, and in a way that palpably went against the grain of my character's motivations.  Why would I be getting involved with a nickelodeon producer?

12.  The non-nature graphics of this game are not good.  In particular, I'm thinking of the animation of people's faces.  Really, this is the best gaming technology can do by this point?  I might have been impressed in the late 90's, but by this point . . .

13.  There's no way to skip many of the cutscenes!  Interminably idiotic dialogue!

14.  If you die unexpectedly (e.g., a fall, a wild animal, an unexpected encounter), you are not resurrected anywhere near the action, but at the point of your last save!  Why!?  Why do I have to ride clear across country again?  Are the game makers trying to punish me for something?  This wasn't fun.  Game is supposed to be fun, not infuriating.

15.  You can't swim!  I found this ridiculous.  I thought my cowboy was supposed to be a hero!  Are you telling me I can be killed by a 2-foot-deep puddle?

16.  Game is not clear when it's saving or which values it is saving.  If you loot bodies, the money you net is not saved if you then die.  But if you meet someone, that is saved.  Clarity and consistency on this would have helped.

17.  You can't zoom in on anything to get a good look at it.

18.  Load times are pure murder.

19.  Why does the game orient you in the completely opposite direction after you've looted a body?  Are you trying to get me killed?  This can be very disorienting in the middle of a fight.

20.  Speaking of which, am I supposed to loot bodies or not?  It seems vaguely dishonorable, but the real problem is that if you don't, the bodies sometimes magically disappear after the combat is finished.  Hence am I to assume you're supposed to loot them DURING combat?  If so, then why do the NPC's either run along or claim you've abandoned them when you take a minute to loot your fallen enemies?  All the while I played the game I couldn't tell if I was supposed to be looting bodies or not.

21.  One needs to access the map so frequently that it should have been only one click away, not two.

22.  Game is very confusing about why some items in the general store, the gunsmith, etc. are not available.  Is it because the attendant missions are not yet unlocked?  Because of my low heroic ranking?  Because they don't sell that in this part of New Austin?  Because the shopkeeper is temporarily out of stock.  This kept me confused the entire time I was playing the game.

23.  Your hero can't climb most things.  I found this preposterous.  It really takes you out of the game, as this is not you fighting the hard world of the Wild West but you butting heads against the clunky command interface of the game.  I can't climb on top of a wooden crate, yet I'm a legend in the land?!

24.  The prices for ammo were preposterous:  twenty-five samoleons for 5 repeater bullets?!  And this is at ""hero"" prices!

25.  There sure were a lot of uninvited adventures dumped on your character.  I don't think games should get you in an adventure whose failure entails a penalty -- without first seeking your consent.  For example, suddenly you've got to drop everything you're doing and rescue the sheriff held captive somewhere in Tumbleweed.  If you don't, the adventure will disappear and you'll lose the benefit of completing it.  Shouldn't I get to at least consent to this by stepping on a golden X or something?

26.  I must have the stupidest horse in the cosmos.  When I whistle, he comes running, but nowhere near me.  Is he playing mind games with me?  Then, when I start shooting, the horse actually steps between me and the targets!  Does he desire his own destruction?  There should have been some way of shooing the horse off.

27.  You can't load your weapon at will.  Basically only in the middle of a fight.

28.  The auto aim system really blows.  You end up doing most of the work anyhow.

29.  The game bizarrely equips you with your hunting dagger just after releasing you from a cutscene right before facing a dozen distant enemies.  It sure wasn't me who equipped my hunting dagger!

30.  In the very last mission of the main storyline, the game deals with the player in bad faith, implying that something in possible when it's scripted and unavoidable.

31.  Taming a wild horse was so poorly programmed.  It took me nearly till the end of the game to realize that you're not supposed to be L'ing and R'ing based on which direction Marston is leaning -- as one would think -- but rather based on which way the head's horse is facing.  Am I the only one this stupid?

Leiby,"(...)P>I've played some god-awful adventure games in my day, but I've got to say that without a doubt, this is perhaps the most unplayable I've ever attempted to endure.  Game of the Year?  Best adventure game ever?  I'm boggled by the reviews.  I'm a world-class cheapskate, and I'll finish any game just to say I got my money's worth, but this thing is just insufferable.
Let's take a look at the blow-by-blow:
1. But it's got gorgeous graphics -- Ok, the scenery's pretty.  Know what?  So was the scenary in Myst, and that suckers a good 5+ years older than TLJ.  And let's keep in mind that when people are raving about the graphics, they're referring to the SCENERY; if it moves in the game (i.e. the characters), then its blocky and clunky.  I've seen better quality in full motion video games than the character models in this thing.
2. The voice acting -- Yeah, it's good, which indeed is a rarity these days.  I must confess that I found the main character annoying after a while, but the voice acting was certainly top-notch.  But what good is voice acting when . . . .
3. They never shut up -- That's right.  Never.  Never ever.  And every time you meet a character, you're going to find these enourmous dialogue trees, with layers on layers of their childhood, their sexual proclivities, their hopes, their dreams, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.  And, in true adventure game style, you never know which little bit is going to yield that crucial bit of information that you need to progress the game.  So you sit and you listen and you pray for death to come.
4. The story is just lame -- Maybe I just have a chip on my shoulder, but what kind of hippie, new age, gobbledy-gook is this?  What was the writer smoking?  I'm quite forgiving, particularly in the realm of sci-fi and fantasy, but this thing is just trite and uninspiring.  My favorite thing about the game is that it'll put some outlandish rule out there, which normally I'd just accept without thinking, but then they try and EXPLAIN it, and it makes no sense.  For example:
  * Crazy outlandish rule -- So there needs to be a new Guardian every 1000 years.
  * Me -- Gotcha.  1000 years.  New Guardian.  Check
  * Expository character who can't stop rambling -- Oh but there's a good reason for the 1000 year cap: the soul can't be separated from the body for longer than that.
  * Me -- HUH?!?!?!
5. It's still all the annoyances of adventure gameplay -- To top it all off, you're still going to be bogged down in the apparently unbreakable rules of an adventure game:
  A) If you know what you need, but you can't find it, examine every stinking thing in your inventory 'cause it's probably hidden inside something else
  B) If you know you need to use something in a specific way, but it just doesn't seem to work, you probably simply haven't placed the object in PRECISELY the right spot to trigger the action
  C) When all else fails, spend half and hour blindly trying to combine items in your inventory, and waving inventory items across the screen.  With any luck, you'll stumble across the completely unintuitive Rube-Goldbergian contraption/technique that the game's designers decided was the only possible way to open a window.  If you're less lucky, it means you don't have the right item, so go revisit every location and try to pick up everything you can.  Once you've got something new, repeat blind inventory combining and/or waving until you're allowed to proceed to the next 20 minute monologue on the Balance and the Disc and the Key which is the Disc which has been broken into four which are the keys of the Disc for the Balance.

I hadn't played it ever but my friend rented it and played it for like 10 hours and he said it was stupid cuz all the best things I love about FF were gone. Here are some of the complaints I've heard from friend and internet people who have played the first couple of chapters of the game:

To linear! I miss the happiness of being in a dungeon and having two places to walk: one I was supposed to go to and another that I wasn't supposed to go to yet! Think of how many amazing random encounters I missed that I couldn't avoid while I was trying to backtrack just to get where I needed to be. Also I missed the fun of older FF games where I was sent to a world map and I didn't know which town was the one town I should go to next. I hate not being tricked into thinking I have options!
No world map! I love the world map, early in the game it lets me spend time trying to figure out next place to walk while facing random enemies that offered no valuable Exp! But most of all later in the game when the world map is actually used to do side quests, exploration, leveling up, and finding sweet treasure! I mean its not like FF13 is going to let the player have access to one of the most awesome and epic worlds with a million giant dinosaurs and tons of quests, items, and amazing stuff like that 20-30 whole hours in! I mean 20-30 hours is probably when the game should be over TWICE!
Towns! My favorite part about FF games is going into a town and listening to people say stuff and looking for the shops then healing at the inn. Sometimes I would spend up to 30 minutes running errands that now take only a minute! Now all the shops can be accessed from the save point and I don't get to hear stuff like... ok, so I don't actually remember anything useful anyone has ever said in a town, but that's ok because I can still complain!
Battles! Wow, I can only control one guy! What kind of combat is this, some kind of strategy type of junk?! I want to be able to pick fight for my fighter, then pick magic from my magic guy and then pick cure from my healer every time even if they don't need healing cuz she's a healer and thats what she does. It looks so unnatural to see everybody moving at the same time. I like waiting while they stand there before they take turns to attack! That's why I hated Advent Children, it was way too fast paced and the fighting was too epic for my sensibilities.
Minigames! What? You mean I don't get to raise Chocobos for 20 hours to unlock one rare item? There's no minigames at all in the first 10 hours which means the entire game is one big on-rails series of battles!

I met many people in the game and developed many friends, worked tirelessly to advance my character, and had a whole lot of fun. For a guy who loves Star Wars and a guy who likes computer gaming, this game was fantastic. But all that changed on the dark day of April 28, 2005, when Sony Online Entertainment butchered this game in a weak attempt to lighten it up for casual players they hoped to draw in after Episode III.

I will not get into specifics, but suffice to say this so called ""Combat Upgrade"" tore the soul out of this game. A mass exodus of easily fifty-percent of the game's total playerbase commenced within the first few weeks of this patch- some of these players being veterans of the games who had been playing for nearly two years. Glitches were abound, balance fell apart, and it became so bitterly comical that my character, a pretty experienced avatar, fell dead to the killer sting of a butterfly in game. Combine this with the fact that some people's characters are irrefutably damaged, many of my personal in-game items including my home and weapons all disappeared, and the fact that this game is now nothing more than a 15 dollar a month exercise in futility and you'll soon realize that this is one game you don't want to own.

So be smart. Don't buy Star Wars Galaxies or its derivitives. It costs money to play, and there are more bugs and glitches in this game than in the first release of it back in August of 2003. It breaks my heart that I have lost so many friends and a great experience, but this game is truly forsaken. It is not the same game anymore, it is completely different. If you want Star Wars, take it from me: this is no longer it, and is not worthy of anyone's hard-earned cash.","Pre-CU, I would've given it 5",1116720000,12,,

Though DICE has fixed many issues in this game already, it is still riddled with endless annoyances.

I've put in over 100 hours into BF4 hoping it would get better the longer you play it, but it really doesn't.

80% of the time this game is not fun at all.

Things that piss me off:

1. Lag on Conquest Large
2. 3rd person vehicle physics
3. Not all shots do damage (net code related)
4. Shot behind cover (net code related)
5. New item notifications in the menus are broken (notifies of items previously unlocked (orange triangle))
6. Characters awkwardly vibrate when you walk/run into/near a teammate
7. Insertion into game at very end of round
8. Unbalanced servers
9. Spawning (is it too hard for DICE to make a smart spawn system with one simple algorithm: don't spawn in an enemies view or vicinity)
10. Battle pickups broken (how long do you have to hold triangle to pick up these weapons? It's about 2.22399790620 seconds, because if you're off, it'll throw the weapon back down, and 95% of the time this is what happens )
etc
etc
etc

This game doesn't feel fair, and is rarely fun.

Take Battlefield 3, add a bunch of bugs but hide it under new weapons, maps, gadgets, vehicles so hopefully we won't notice the bugs... then you have BF4.

Don't even get me started on the horrible campaign.

I would love to say that I'm going back to Battlefield 3, but I've put in over 400 hours into that game and am done with it. I could try even Bad Company 2, which is my favorite. But the servers are quite empty and the thrill of that great game has worn off when BF3 came out.

I hope to god the next BF game will be amazing and not another crap fest.

I'll play the new DLC's coming out for BF4 because I've already paid for it all, but the fun is just not there. This game is a broken, annoying mess that just gets me pissed off every time I play it. And boy have I tried soooo hard to like it.

It spent about 30 minutes in the system before my kids turned it off in frustration, and we spent 20 of those minutes simply trying to set up in-game avatars for them.

This game is terrible because the Kinect is terrible. I am so sick of the Kinect. It sucks. Its a failure. I should have learned my lesson with the atrocious Kinect Star Wars, but no. My fault. The biggest problem with Kinect is that 99% of its games are designed for kids but it requires the patience & precision of an adult to use. If you are old enough to get around all of its annoying quirks, you are not going to be interested in playing the kiddie Kinect games. If, like my kids, you are age appropriate for the games, the Kinect will be a frustrating obstacle to gameplay and youll be switching back to a controller-operated game after a few minutes.

Anyway, this specific game is for up to two players, and is supposed to scan them into the Pixar world with the Kinect camera. It vaguely does that. The avatar it made for one of my kids looked a little bit like him but not really. You can change some of the avatars features manually, but the Kinect menu interfaces are so frustrating to use we skipped that. The Kinect flat out refused to scan in my other son. At one point you have to stand up straight with your arms & legs spread out, inside a green outline. My son did that, several times but the Kinect refused to register his knees or elbows. It only gives you a few seconds to complete this scan before popping up an error message and forcing you to start the process all the way over again from the beginning. We spent most of our time slogging through this process and I wanted to snap the Kinect in half.

Then we got to the actual game, which wasn't much better than navigating the menus. Kids tend to jump around as they try to have fun with the game, but the Kinect penalizes you for that. My kids would get too far forward or too far right or left, and they had a lot of trouble with the controls. The gameplay is also repetitive and confusing. You run your avatar around with characters from various Pixar movies and are presented with puzzles, sometimes given with no hints. That would be all right for an adult, but its not fun for a 5-year old. One puzzle involved having to jump up on a little raised platform, and the controls are so awful my kids were not able to do it. Theyd either jump past it, over it, or theyd jump and the Kinect wouldnt recognize they were jumping.

If you want a fun Kinect game for your kids, get Kinect Party. Even if you manage to get through the avatar creation menus in Kinect Rush, there is no reward waiting for you in playing the actual game. Hopefully I can get a dollar or two for this junk on trade in.","Waste of time, just like the Kinect itself.",1418860800,,,

Even the sales clerk at the retail store where I bought the game from last Friday tried to warned me to not buy the game.  I should of listened.

I bought the first game Crysis last year and I installed that game on my computer and it installed fine.  I love playing that game. I thought since I bought the first Crysis game I would go out and buy the follow up game, Crysis Warhead. I just had to have this game.  So I went out last Friday and bought Crysis Warhead and went home and tried to install the game onto my PC computer.

Big mistake. The game started to download onto my computer and all of sudden it stopped and it said ""Error Message"".  The error message said first of all I needed to be connected to the internet to install the game.  So I thought okay I would go ahead and do that.  So I tried to download the game again with the internet connected to my computer.  Okay so the game started to download and I got the same error message again.  Only this time it said I need to register my game.  I'm like wait a minute.  I put in the registration code at the beginning of the game and now it's asking me for a registration code?  So I had to take out the game and try to register it again.  The game started to download and then I got another error message telling me that SecuROM does not recognize my registration code and will not let me finish downloading the game.  Do you know after all that hassle I took the game out of my computer and it screwed up my computer.  That SecuROM is like putting a virus into your computer.  I am not kidding you.

I try to get back into the original Crysis game on my PC after all this and it screw up my computer so I can't get into the Crysis game.  I ended up taking Crysis out of computer and now the computer won't let me reinstall Crysis back into my computer.  Then on top of all this it, SecuROM screwed up my drives so that I can't watch any DVD movies on my PC.  SecuROM get into your operating system in your computer and screws up everything and you can't take it out.

I contacted EA Games Customer Service Department and they told me just to keep reinstalling Crysis Warhead until it finally works.  What kind of answer is that?  I told them my PC is all screw up because of Crysis Warhead and the stupid SecuROM that came with it.  They said I need to see things from a business point of view.  They're trying to make money and keep people from stealing the game by putting in SecuROM.  I told them in twenty years of playing PC games I have never had so much trouble installing a game except when it comes to any PC games through EA Games.  That includes Spore which is a joke.

I remember earlier this year when a long time Game Reviewer for Gamespot got fired for giving a bad review to a game because the Game Publisher didn't like the low review the Game Reviewer had given one of their games. I personally don't work for in the gaming industry.  I'm just an average guy who trying to help people so they don't get ripped off.

That SecuROM should only go to Third World Countries because that is really the only place where piracy takes place.  This is not right to treat honest paying customers this way by EA Games.  Thank you Amazon for giving us freedom of speech and letting us tell people the truth about these inferior PC games.

The reason I bought ""Grid"" was that it had garnered enough reviews on Metacritic to earn the place of the most favorably-reviewed racing game for the Playstation.  After having played it for weeks I wonder how many hours those reviewers actually played it.

For me, at least, the thing was unwinnable.  It was so difficult as to be ridiculous, even on ""Basic"" difficulty.  I like to come home from work and want to unwind for an hour or so with a racing game.  This seemed as good as any other, but after a few weeks passed, I noticed that I wasn't making any progress in the game, since I wasn't winning any races.

This is because:

1.  All the camera angles are so low that you can't really see much of the road ahead of you.  Therefore to avoid crashing you are forced to travel at speeds slower than those necessary to win even the simplest races.  As a result, the only way to really win a race is, essentially, to memorize the track.  But this strikes me as boring and not unlike memorizing maze patterns in Pac-Man.

2.  The physics of the game are completely absurd.  Since when do cars invariably and eternally speed out of control because you floor it when you're on grass or gravel?  I have a car and do that from time to time:  my car does not spin in absurd circles when I do.  The physics of the game and the interaction with other cars was all convincing and realistic until you got off the track.  When you did, Bizarro World rules suddenly same into play.

If you do buy it, I would at least recommend buying it for PC.  That way, you can avail yourself of the many trainers available for the game and at least make some progress in it.",hated it,1271030400,6,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

I am really shocked at the overall low quality of the Xbox One components.  The controller itself is very poorly designed and it creaks and squeaks...it just feels cheap, the headset is total junk...connectors on it went bad very quickly and the mic quit working so I have already had to replace it with a new (in just over a month) and now these issues with the play and charge kit.  Microsoft should be ashamed and embarrassed by the very low, low, low quality of these ""next generation"" peripherals...I am embarrassed for them.

so i will sum up the pros and cons of the game:

+around 150 teams to choose from
+game plays smoothly on the ps3
+startup and menus are cool
+difficulty isn't too hard

-arena graphics are terrible. there aren't any to speak of. i don't feel like i am looking at a college basketball game. the arenas look like walls with dots for the students/fans. phog allen fieldhouse looks like a boxed in room.

Surely if it was popular enough to get a second game to come over to america then there must be something to it that must draw people in, right? Is it the odd concept for a game? Was it the fighting? The dating? I had to know what it was that drew people in, so I went out and bought the limited edition and tried it. After playing for 30 hours I can say that I have no idea. The dungeons are repetitive, the girls are very much the clich female types in a harem games and the main character is very much a Marty Stue. The kids were adorable, but I did not have much attachment to them because the main character cycled through them so fast and they had no characterization/backstory. The battle system was also very repetitive and I had no incentive to go to the next dungeon, I only did because the plot told me to. Grinding was unnecessary because the bosses never gave me much of a challenge, however if you wanted to get in good with the girls I found that it was almost necessary to enter the dungeons more than was needed. Forced grinding made me lose interest to stop playing it early even though I feel like I am near the end.
Dating was so easy; give the girl a gift and answer correctly (though, answering correctly did not matter that much because if you choose the wrong answer you could just come back, give a gift and make it all better) the multiple choice options. Which is typical for a dating-style game, but not entirely inventive and hardly the thing I would imagine to bring players to this game. It was scarily easy to woo even the most stubborn of the girls which made it hard to feel like I accomplished something by the end.
I understand it is an interesting concept, but the battle system, plot and character descriptions could have been written by a 5 year old. I would not have minded the fact that the girls were so fanservice-y if the game itself was even slightly interesting. I find I can't finish this game.

First off the the story and dialogue will bore you to suicide.

the dialogue is so tedius and meaningless its just a waste of time. The apparently ""Gay"" member of your group will sit and talk about how in love he is with the other male character for way too long and other conversations that have nothing to do with gameplay take way too long.

Also the battles are boring. I have played RPGs and turn based games for years and the combat on this game is uninspired  and just flat out lame.

Alot of this game is way too drawn out. conversations and movies and boring and have no story value and take forever to get through. Dont get me wrong sometimes a long cutscene is cool if its telling the story and is exciting and well done. these are not like that at all.

Also, time has taught me that the mesh covering the speakers can become rather uncomfortable during a long gaming session and leaves imprints on my ears. This might indicate that they are too tight on my head.

Has great sound for the price.  Granted the base is not as strong as some of the $150+ headphones, but I can hear footsteps and other subtle clues quite well.  [It is not as sturdy as some of the (much) more expensive headphones, but for $25, I did not expect it to be.  If you don't rip it off your head it should last].  Make sure that you rotate the mic down until it clicks, or else it will remain muted (this is an excellent feature in my opinion).

Also, the individual chat/game sound adjustment on the inline volume control is key and adds exactly what I wanted to COD Advanced warfare, as unlike some previous COD games, it does not have an option to mute all players by default.  I no longer need to individually mute all the players in a lobby.  This is really handy as you will know if you play the game.

EDIT: I compared these to a lot of other much more expensive headsets and found that these are the best for hearing footsteps and other similar audio cues. I did not bother with the warranty return/exchange process and ultimately bought a second pair. Though I was quite gentle with them, they broke anyway after a few months' use. I am really at a loss as to what rating is appropriate. I have considered just buying a third pair, as warranty repair/replace is a big hassle, but at the same time, they do not perform their function as headsets for very long, and cannot receive more than 1 star.

My apologies for not writing a complete and thorough review, but this is going to be a scathing review and I didn't get past trying this headset on. Therefore, allow me to iterate. I did not purchase this headset from Amazon, but rather visited a local retailer who price matches with Amazon to get the advertised discounted price. I was excited to finally get my hands on a Skullcandy product since I typically shy away from products that are geared toward and advertised to our younger gaming generation. So why did I give this gaming headset 1 star? Let me explain. After I opened the Skullcandy PLYR2 box, I felt like I had been ripped off. For starters, this is an on-the-ear gaming headset. A look at Skullcandy's homepage for this specific headset will not give any useful information that you won't find anywhere else like here on Amazon. You'll probably notice that the Amazon information for this headset is more descriptive than Skullcandy's own website. I could not find mentioned anywhere on any webpage, nor any review (none that I could find), that this is an on-the-ear gaming headset. Folks, I'm an adult over 40. I don't have big ears. I have average sized adult ears. When I opened the box and had my first look, I knew I had been duped and this put an immediate bad taste in my mouth. I unwrapped the headset and tried it on just to be absolutely sure I wasn't hallucinating (which by the way this should be the VERY FIRST thing you, the buyer, should do for ANY gaming headset). Sure enough, the earpieces sat right on top of my ears. So, I thought that maybe you have to sort-of wrap the earpieces around the ear. Nope! This is definitely an on-the-ear gaming headset, plus it is very tight on an average adults head. Folks, that's not what bothers me. I have 4 pairs of on-the-ear gaming headsets (2 pairs of Astro A30's, 1 pair of Tritton Kama's and 1 pair of Mad Catz Frequency M's). I like them all, each and every one of them. That said, when I purchased those headsets, I knew from the start that they were on-the-ear gaming headsets. This is information that the buyer needs in order to help them decide to buy or not buy a particular product, right? So, why not include that in the description? Secondly, upon closer visual inspection, this gaming headset LOOKS CHEAP!!! I just could not believe this company was asking big money for this cheap looking headset. Thirdly, the colors of the headset and the graphic artwork are not representative of what you'll see out of the box. Here on this webpage, you'll notice that the yellow is more gold in color, the black appears to be a matte black finish and apparently there's some graphic artwork that is overlaid onto the earpieces. When you open the box and just look, you'll find that what you thought was a golden yellow color is actually a bright yellow, you'll find that what you thought was supposed to be a matte black finish is actually a glossy black finish and you'll find that the graphic artwork overlay on the earpieces does not exist. Furthermore, this gaming headset is NOT as mobile friendly as it's portrayed to be! You have to have power to drive this silly thing, because otherwise, you may as well leave this one at home! Folks, I don't know what you all think about this, but we used to call this misleading and false advertising. All of this alone was enough for me to place the headset back into it's box and return it.

In summation, I cannot recommend this product at all. This is simply due to principle. Think about it like this: You own a company that produces and sells widgets. You market and advertise your widgets to be shiny, colorful and ambidextrous (this means you can use both hands to use the product). However, what you actually sell are widgets that have 1 color, they're dull and only for right handed people. How long do you think it's going to take for customers to figure out whats' going on and start passing the word around about your falsely advertised widgets? I'll leave you with that thought.",Look Elsewhere!,1424217600,,{'Color:': ' Black/ Yellow'},

I wasn't aware of that. I knew newer games - like Rome II - are Steam driven, that's why I will never buy them. But I thought that NTW, a 2009-10 product, was still what most of PC games were for decades: a DVD (CD - and even floppy disks - before that) distributed software that you could install in your PC all by yourself. Then, since Doom II ages, if you wished and if you wanted, you could pick a multiplayer mode based on LAN first, and the Internet later. But it was always your choice, AFTER you had your game installed in your hard drive.

There is a specific - and abusive - reason you can't play anymore any Steam game from a LEGALLY bought USED media (DVD or whatever). Key word here is USED, meaning that the original owner HAD to register the game in Steam, in order to be allowed to play it, doesn't matter he/she bought it in DVD format.

After that happens, Steam does not provide any mean at all of making the game available to a second hand user.

I'm not talking here of two people (original and second hand owners) using at the same time one single license for the game, no.

What I find totally abusive and ill intentioned, is that Steam refuses to deactivate the original account, once a second person tries to register in Steam the same game license again. It doesn't matter that you provide them with proper proof of purchase, Amazon invoices and such. They ignore all that, and send you to SEGA customer ""support"". Once you reach SEGA, you are told plain and simple: we don't want you to buy a USED copy (at 11.99), we want you to buy a NEW one (at 54.99).

So where is all this scheme intended? Simply, to kill the second hand market of software.

To be fair I have to acknowledge the totally nice and sympathetic attitude of the reseller - ""Wonderbook"", whom, after I explained all this, refunded my money without even wanting me to send back the DVD package. I'm sure they took due notice and retired from their offer any other DVD game prone to suffer the same destiny: a waste of time (and money from the reseller part).","Don't buy an used DVD copy, won't be able to use it.",1381708800,5,"{'Edition:': ' Limited', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

- Has the elements of a decent third person shooter.

Cons:

- Abysmal game mechanics do not mesh with the control settings, making sure you are having a hard time just trying  to get around a level.

- Buggy gameplay insures you get hit with as many cheap attacks as possible.

- Broken game mechanics make the game next to unplayable, such as blind fire being almost as accurate as aiming, melee attacks keeping enemies in a state of lock, and enemy attacks that knock you down in succession of each other.

- Awful lighting and color palette.  Each scene is taken up by a single color most of the time, making any sense of scale or depth impossible, and when that isn't happening, the game is pitch black, even with the gamma all the way up on a bright TV setting.

Unfortunately, the side effect of this weapon strike is that hell's minions now have an easy exit to the earth's surface. In addition to that is an escaped experimental supersoldier, developed by Spawn's primary earthly adversary, Jason Wynn.
Now that you know what the game is about, you can know how bad it is.
First off, you have an extremely lackluster fighting system.  Press punch once and you'll swing Spawn's axe.  Press it twice, and it does a different one swing attack.  Press it three times and you get 1 combo.  So basically it goes (1) uppercut slash, (2) a forward flip attack, and (3) a jumping axe slam attack. How exciting is that?  There's also a one swoop jump attack, but you will only need this in special cases and even then it becomes repetative.
Second, the guns are pretty useless, when it comes down to it.  I'm curious why no one in the production team thought to ask why have guns, if you can't find enough ammo to use them adequately?
If the game has any saving grace, I would have to say it lies in both your chain attacks and the special moves as they are fairly interesting.  The chain attacks are by far the best thing this game has going for it.  You can either use them to simply pummel your foes back to the underworld or you can send them there in pieces, literally splitting them to the four winds!
The special moves are called ""Hell Attacks"" and there is a meter to regulate how much you can abuse it, because let's face it, you will.  Most of them are various projectile attacks, but the most useful ones would be the time-dilation effect and the furies from hell.
The time-dialtion basically gives you the ability to move faster than everyone else, or slow everyone down, depending on how you look at it.
As for the furies, Spawn has the ability to summon a group of spirits from hell to attack an intented victim.  A very satisfying move indeed.
The absolute worst part of this game are the jump puzzles.  Who puts jump puzzles in a superhero game?  It defies all reason.  You will need to use your cape and chain power to pull off these ridiculous yet necessary excersizes.
Don't expect good music either.  This game has the most dreariest hum tones I've ever heard.  There's simply no life to it.

Having been disappointed last year by the lackluster C&C 3: Tiberium Wars (which, like its predecessor, suffered horribly for speed and gameplay issues, while RA: 2 did not, nor did the excellent C&C: Generals) I was hoping RA: 3 would take me back to what got me into these games--fun, challenging missions, a bit of humor, and hours of fun.

What I got was...C&C3, dumbed down.  I mean really dumbed down.  I'm not talking about the FMV scenes or the hot babes (most of whom out-acted the ""professional"" actors who appeared in C&C3), which I was prepared for, but the gameplay itself:

--Units just about crawl across the screen.  Even fast-movers, like MiG jets, take forever to get anywhere.  You're forever jumping back and forth trying to see where the unit you just sent to attack is, if it hasn't already been destroyed.  And there is NO option to change that speed.  If there is, it's well-hidden.

--Too much power:  RA1 & 2 started you off with relatively weak units and gave you a challenge by having you overcome enemies using them.  Not so here--you're handed units capable of doing major damage almost from the start.  It takes a good chunk of challenge from any mission, which is not helped by the

--AI Commanders, or as I thought of them, ""cannon fodder"".  Using these guys means every mission can play out the same--you send them out to distract the enemy, while you build up your forces and go for the win.  That's fun about...one time.  After that it just sucks out any challenge there might have been, and you don't have the option to turn these guys off.

--Loooong load times at startup.  I swear, it takes a full minute or more just to reach the main menu!  Worse, it took a full 2 hours to install this--actual installation itself to about 1/2 hour, the remaining hour and a half was spent trying to stop the game from trying to install itself twice (running two versions of setup) and crashing in the process.

Are there any good points?  Well, you get some very attractive ladies to look at in the FMV scenes, and there's George Takei, who really plays the role of the Emperor of the Rising Sun very well.  The units are surprisingly varied though infantry is pretty weak.  Graphics are pretty.  Music is kind of cool.  But beyond that...nope.  Don't waste your money.

Getting through the first two stages of that tutorial was fine, but then after that insane load time again, the next part comes up (still a tutorial I realized), where you're supposed to follow some simple steps to Lady Gaga's ""Bad Romance"". Since ""Bad Romance"" was one of the songs I'd added to my dance playlist, the first few times I thought it was the actual beginning of my playlist. Unfortunately not, it turns out, since the stupid AI dance teacher was still there, ""training"" me. After literally doing this same segment a good twelve times - during which it didn't matter HOW accurately I did the move, the stupid system continued to read the SAME moves as not done properly - the green success gauge at the bottom of the screen indicated that I'd done enough moves right to progress to the next segment, and I'd hear audience cheers, but that was IMMEDIATELY followed by boos and a declaration from the teacher of ""let's try that again"".

Uhm, how 'bout no? I'm taking this piece of junk back to the store tomorrow. Too bad, because the song list IS awesome, but how good is a game that you can't play, or that makes you want to fling the stupid game over your balcony? In short, I think, not very. Done. SO done with this game. Even for the under $20 price I found this for at a local Big Lots store, it's not worth it.

Dance Central (which I've owned for a while) is SO much better than this game. Of course, that explains why Dance Central is still listed as full price, and this one is less than half its original release-date price. Buy this at your own risk, even IF you tend to  be inordinately patient. This game is simply an exercise in frustration for me.",More like Dance Hell! And my copy is just fine...

Now, I'll admit that I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan (read: I saw one movie when I was eight), but I am a huge RPG fan, and this game plummets far below my expectations. I will describe my experience with the game, and hopefully you will choose to pass it by and skip the agony I went through.

At the start of the game, I was asked to choose my character's appearance, skill point allocation, and basic moveset. Sounds fun and cool, right? That's what I thought, too. Until I realized that every character model was blocky and pseudo-realistic (you know, that weird, pale, supposed-to-look-human-but-really-doesn't look), the skill-point system was convoluted and confusing to anyone who isn't a hardcore Dungeons and Dragons player, and choosing my moves was so difficult and frustrating that in the end, I didn't even know which ones I had. Creating the character took an hour, and I didn't feel at all satisfied after I finished.

Once I started the actual game, things only got worse. I headed to my first battle, expecting a standard turn-based system at the least, and an innovative action/RPG blend at the most. I got neither. Instead, I was greeted a bizarre mess. In fact, this combat system was so strange and awkward that I don't think I could even describe it. All I know is that, first off, my character was somehow moving on its own, and second, the commands I entered didn't seem to effect what happened onscreen at all.

After making my way through several battles, by way of random button mashing and liberal use of medpacks (that was the easiest way to do it, and seemed to have the same result as trying to concentrate and strategize), I met my first party member. What happened after that just plain scared me. First, the voiceovers made me want to both laugh and scream. Secondly, while the horrendous voice is grating your ears, you have to look at a disturbing close-up of the character's face as he's talking. And finally, THE FACE DOESN'T CHANGE. His expression stayed exactly the same throughout the entire conversation, and this happened with every single other character I talked to. Freaky.

The final part of the game that I played through was the first city. It was big, with lots of people walking around, going about their lives. This would be cool, if I had known where to go in this massive maze. But did I? Nope. Although my horribly-voiced partner apparently knew the city well, I recieved no guidance from him. Instead, he followed me around, giving me no hints but the instruction to ""find Bastilla"". By the way, I knew nothing about what Bastilla looked like or where she might be.

After twenty minutes of running around in the maze, talking to random, badly-voiced people, most of whom had mean things to say, I gave up. Maybe people who like Star Wars and D&D will appreciate this, but I just can't.

Game Concept (being able to hijack certain enemies)(little secret ways to earn more points)
Music (Got some wonderful beats to go along with the game)
Character designs (especially that lady Sasha) is very well done, and has a high level of polish. (To bad the rest of the game doesn't)
Aesthetics
Character viewer is a cool concept

Things that are horrid:
Level design looks half done, it's poorly done...
Game Controls (IE how the game character responds to input.. the fighting, which is the main aspect of the game, is poorly executed. It should be smooth like Bolthouse farm Vanilla chai tea... yet its more akin to .. drinking black coffee, a horrid frustrating experience)

Gameplay (How they set the rules of the game up) are horrid... some things in the game, take more luck to pull off, than skill, just because of how they set up events. Like I'm doing a mission called ""Impeding Investigation"" during the white(good) selection of the game. This giant mining excavator goes berserk.. WEll.. not only does it kill the enemies before I can get to them, it moves fast enough to where basically all I can do is focus on avoiding it and staying alive, yet last long enough.. (it does two laps over the battlefield) to eat up a major chunk of my time limit, and then enemies spawn way to dang slow. I just beat this mission with literally 8 seconds left, and that was slaughtering enemies as fast as I possibly could. (I'm sure with a lot of practice one could beat it quicker some how, but it would also probably take luck)

I don't feel like going on, but over all its a poorly executed idea of a game. Cool in theory, but the team behind it...they suck at doing their job. That would sum it up. I was looking forward to this game, and well.. frankly I'm let down.

I've been a gamer for 20 years now. And it seems that a lot of game designers/developers, whatever you want to call them, have still yet to grasp how freaking important it is, to get the input right.. how important it is the way that the character responds to the user, how the environment responds to the user character. If their is this disconnect, this struggle to get the game to function the way it is intended, its going to be a horrible experience. I could deal with a graphically, or aesthetically lacking game, if it were a great gameplay experience.. and that's not the case with this game. Also, the camera/lock on is horrid as well. I felt like I was playing a game from th eyear 2000 or something.. gezus.

Also, the boss fight against a certain huge creature, that lives in the water, is so poorly done, that I got nauseated the second time I was forced to go through the fight. I dreaded it that much. Its a fight that get's drug out for no good reason.

Story for the game is Ok. Its simple, but good.

I played the game on Normal Difficulty. On the 360 version with a Razer Sabertooth Controller.

With a lot of missions you get 3 tries. With the last boss. You get three tries, and do to the poor game design, it took me three tries exactly.

The first thing I tried was the multiplayer. The first thing that I noticed was how slowly paced the gameplay was. Cod is known for their fast-paced gameplay, but there are several times during the match when I don't even hear gunshots around me. Also, half the time I die is when an opponent hits me with a crowbar or punches me with boxing gloves, and that gets old and boring very fast. Also, the maps are layed out terribly, and the game is geared for campers. The hit detection is also terrible, you know, when you shoot your opponent 15 times, but your opponent kills you in 2 shots. The other thing that drives me crazy in this game are the DLCs. I'm not against the idea of DLCs, as long as there's a decent content to price ratio. I haven't bought any of the DLCs because they are very over priced. Each DLC costs $15, and all that's included are a few new multiplayer maps, and a zombies map. And we all know about the campaign, it is very boring. I quit after the second mission, and so did many of my friends. As far as the zombies gameplay, it isn't bad, it can just be very confusing if you are used to BO2 zombies. Overall, the thing that pisses me off the most about this game is that in MP, about 50% of the time, you don't even die from a gun, you die from boxing gloves, crow bars, extremely overpowered kill streaks, etc. If this game was $1, it would still be over priced.

One extremely annoying new ""feature"" was the random battle encounter gauge. Unlike 2 where you would get a ""!"" above your head so that you could run away from a random battle,WA3 only lets you do this 10 times,then you HAVE to fight.
Another bad feature was the fact that everyone uses guns;you can hit with your fists(when your out of ammo)but it does such lame damage that it's not even worth trying. Also the personal skills system was changed for the worse(having to equip an item,fight so many battles and then having the item dissapear after you've learned the skill)
The characters and the story were also short of my expectations for the series. While janus & co.(bad guys) were sometimes funny and sometimes despicable,they were nowhere near as great as say liz & ard from part 2. The game also felt like it was TRYING to make a story just to give you a point to do things,whereas the previous two installments had great stories to them which also just happened to be games.
The only good thing about this game is the graphics;not the ahh and ooo 3D type,but the fact that all of the characters looked like they were hand painted with water colors,and that was impressive. The only noticable music in the game was the traditonal wild arms opening that's heard during the train scene after you play all four character intros. The very start was sung in voices with a hymn-like effect;very nice. Everything afterward is just hum drum,average run-of-the-mill.

It turns out that is nothing but a marketing strategy, because passing is useless in FIFA 14. Now, let me review the game prior to the patch, and after it was released. Before the patch was issued, you can manage to string a couple of passes in the midfield, and create scoring opportunities. The main glitch that pressured EA to release a patch was for the overpowered lobs and headers. Online, 9/10 headers from lobs result in a goal. EA saw the problem, and proceeded to rectify with the patch that was released last week. Now, one would think that all EA needed to do was adjust the sliders, to allow for mixed header possibility. Well, not necessarily. What EA did was copy and paste the garbage that FIFA 13 was, onto FIFA 14, and claimed the game is fixed now. One should have known something was up, since there is no way EA addresses bugs and issues that rapidly. A patch released a couple of weeks after release? So, FIFA 14 is a roster update. You can control the possession, shots, and whatever you like. The player with the least amount of advantage will win. Before the patch, I was winning some, but also losing some. It made the game fun. However, post patch, my record is 3-20. 12 shots on goal, 9 of them get deflected near the box, despite an opening, and the rest hit the post. I had a player hit a header on an empty net, and he still hit the post. (opponent pulled his goal to the side, and I went for the cross.) Nice try, EA. Advertise a new game with emphasis on midfield passing, but patch it to help the noobs. Figures, since the 12 year olds that make up 80 percent of your sales don't know what a midfield is.

Quick Pros:
Arkham Asylum/City-like combat (also a con ...)
Web-Rush
Web-Retreat
Boss-Battles

Quick Cons:
Spider-Man is not Batman and should have not been treated that way

I will give Beenox props for attempting a free roaming spider-man game when they haven't before (that effort has gone to Treyarch in the past) -- but what Beenox has delivered is very much not the free-roaming ""open world"" game that I was expecting. In comparison, the last free-roaming spider-man game was Web of Shadows (Treyarch) and the majority of my Spider to Spider comparison is to that. First off, Manhattan is not important in this game, there is very little to no interaction with the city or the people and the city is basically a backdrop as you very boringly swing from one location/objective to the next (swinging has been considerably dumbed down), which made swinging more of a chore than fun as it was in WoS (or Spider-Man 2). Also, the majority of the missions take place underground or inside, there are only two or three missions that actually take place on the streets (or the air) of Manhattan, so I felt overly claustrophobic for someone playing an ""open world"" game.

Also, there's no accepting or declining of ""random"" missions in the environment, afaik they're not ""random"" and you can't ""decline"" them you can just ignore them -- I ""accepted"" all of them so I don't know if they go away or just stay on your map but in WoS there were truly, randomly generated events in the world to take care of. And there's also no real variation in gameplay (or choices to make) or anything like that.

The reason I'm sticking with a 1-star review is because the game is not what I was told it would be. Honestly, if Beenox/Activision was advertising this along the veins of Shattered Dimensions, as a level based game that majorly took place indoors (or in enclosed spaces), I probably would give it 2.5 or 3-stars, but because it was advertised as a free-roaming, open world, random-encounter-laden game akin to Spider-Man 2 and Web of Shadows, I'm giving it one star. Here's to hoping Activision gives the next one to Treyarch (note that both Beenox and Treyarch are subsidiaries of Activision who has the license from Marvel to use Spider-Man). Or at the least Beenox gets the code Treyarch used for Web of Shadows.",Advertised but not delivered,1341619200,4,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

Honestly how can you ruin a game based on something as immensely popular as Star Wars?  Especially so soon in the afterglow of the Episode III DVD release?

SOE shows you how - through doing the exact opposite of what you are taught in every Customer Service class you will ever attend.

1.) Lie to the customers

SOE has lied, constantly, as it relates to changes being made.  A recent lie was advertisements for the latest expansion to Star Wars Galaxies - and promises of new items, etc. for certain professions.  1 Day after charging customers who pre-ordered the expansion - charges fresh on the credit card bills - SOE announced changes to the game which ELIMINATED 21 professions and forced you into one of 9 professions which were broken horribly.

This was actionable enough for a lawsuit that they were forced to give a refund to customers - but of course that took 2 - 7 weeks to process.

2. Don't listen to the customer.

Customer asks for a bug fix?  Offer him an expansion for the modest sum of $30.  Want the bug fix bad enough?  Fork over the $30 or we won't make it.  Character bugged?  Spent 3 years building him up to the level he's at?  Delete him - we can't be bothered to fix him.

3. Call every nerf, everything that changes in the game, etc. to make it more ""Star Warsy"".

""Star Warsy"" is a madeup term crafted in the SOE spin department.  This term was generated in order to say ""I was making things more Star Warsy"" instead of being forced to say ""I was just making 90% of the items you've aquired over the past year worthless.""

Not only do they nerf the players to the point of unplayability - they leave the enemies stronger than ever.

I lose fights to cavemen armed with sticks and wearing loin cloths even though I hit them 50 times with a lightsaber - barely leaving a scratch on them.

This issue is well documented at the CodeMasters Forum site and other sites on the web. Now that I've got it installed the resolution is stuck at 800 x 600 with no way to change it in the graphic settings. Frame rate no longer shows up in graphic settings either.

Its as though my display options have been limited by the DRM to that of a DEMO game when I actually bought the full blown game new! My native resolution is 1920 x 1080 and I have played the game previously at that resolution with no problems. So the fact that it is stuck in 800 x 600 makes this game unplayable for me cause 800 x 600 is real ugly by comparison. All my other games work flawlessly at 1920 x 1080.

1.0,False,"01 26, 2015",A3NESYP0G8MFO5,B00ENQXEX2,Tirsden Frozenrayn,"Pros:

- More food recipes, including a whole other category for gourmet food (though it requires leveling up separately from cooking).

- Paintings from an easel can be painted from a specific category, like abstract or realism (though you will still get a random painting within that category).

- More musical instruments to play.

- More options on the computer, like programming or playing professional game tournaments.

Cons:

- The usual stuff everyone else talks about: crap graphics, tiny town, loading screens, extreme lack of customization (seriously, the available palettes are just sad), and the sims looking particularly cartoony and losing the nicer style they had in Sims 3.

- Plays and looks like a mobile game: the UI especially just screams mobile game, aka lazy programming and design. Remember, we also have Sims 3 to compare this game to, so that makes Sims 4's UI even worse. Digging up gatherables really made me cringe for how mobile-gamey it looks and feels. There are also a lot of superfluous sounds for things that don't need to be there, which is frustrating in a game where sounds should mean ""something needs to be checked on.""

- No obvious way to rotate furniture until way later in the oddly-staggered tutorial-ish lessons. You have to use keys on the keyboard to do something you could do easily with the mouse in Sims 3.

- Multitasking: the much-touted multitasking system does not actually work as hoped. Instead of painting and having a conversation with someone at the same time, the sim will paint a little, then talk, then paint a little more, then talk. The system seems to favor talking, so it's much better to just do the task you're wanting to complete (like painting) and then have the sim talk to someone when their social need requires it. Unfortunately, the game will keep forcing the sim to converse if there is another Sim in the room, and you have to cancel the multitasked conversation yourself every time.

- Bills: after being confounded by a $3,500 bill for a small house, I read on forums that the game calculates bills based off the value of the house plus everything you have in inventory. This is ridiculous. Bills should be calculated the way they were in Sims 3, which appears to involve the size of the house, and the number (and value) of items in the house that use utilities like water and electricity. So, my huge bill was based pretty much entirely off the fact that I had a lot of expensive paintings my sim had painted himself to get the Beautifully Decorated moodlet.

- Emotions: buggy as heck and really obnoxious because this is one of those things that triggers superfluous sounds. My sim painting at his easel would often change emotions if he had to walk across the room to start cooking dinner, and that emotion would come right back as soon as he was done moving (the Beautifully Decorated moodlet would often drop due to moving which is no doubt part of it). One day on his way to work, I saw him switch emotions between four or five different moods within a total of a few seconds. Also, the constant big picture of the sim in the UI showing his or her emotion is just obnoxious and shouldn't be there.

- Eating: it takes forever, and only gets worse if you speed the game up. It would often take over an hour for a sim to finish their meal and they spend most of their time staring into space.

- Stereo system is buggy: I could get one sim to multitask listening to Alternative while she was programming (which gives a moodlet only, thankfully), but if I tried to get the other sim to do the same, it would reset him, halting his painting too. This would happen no matter who else was listening to the stereo, and the only time I ever saw him actually multitask the radio properly was during a dinner party.

- Sims resetting: they do this a lot, at any time of day, for no apparent reason. Sometimes it will reset one sim, but it usually resets both (I assume all sims on the lot but I only played with two in the household). This is something that should have been debugged in alpha, nevermind beta.

- Large groups of sims bug out badly: I decided to go to the lounge (club/bar) with my sim since it seems that sort of thing is one of the only reasons devs think we play the game. Once my sim sat down at the bar, several other sims walked in and were stuck around/behind him waving hello to... me? The bartender? Not sure. This created a heck of a lot of noise from all the talking, and the crowd of people would not move and just kept doing that. In the meantime I tried chatting with the bartender, which actually worked... but ordering chips came to nothing, along with ordering a drink. I left and vowed never to return.

- Sims at home while main sim is elsewhere are unplayable (beyond a loading screen which is pretty much everywhere but the home lot).

- The Create A Sim Demo: the actual game can't find pre-made sims or households from the CAS demo. Also, it would appear there are no more customization choices in the game than there is in the CAS demo, and there is still no long hair for men.

- Uninstalling Sims 4 reset my Sims 3 options to default. Sims 3 is certainly not devoid of problems (that's a whole other rant), but at least it's playable with third-party fan mods to keep it from grinding to an eventual halt even on the best gaming computers. Yes, Sims 3 does often glitch itself back into default settings mode all on its own, but it just felt like Sims 4 gave me a final ""f0rk you"" by mucking with the Sims game I actually like.

I could surely rant more, but even writing this review gives me a headache.

1.0,False,"10 25, 2011",A300S1GRHOCCR5,B005WXIO44,Teromous,"This game includes 2 campaigns; one military based and one centered around repairing and strengthening the kingdom's economy.  It also contains 5 ""Historical Siege"" scenarios where you can either choose to defend or attack a castle.  In these scenarios, you can not build any additional buildings or units, and must rely on what is given to you.  There is no skirmish mode in this game, so single player combat is limited to the one campaign, and these 5 historical sieges.  The game also includes 2 Free Build maps, which are essentially non-combat sandboxes.  You can't set any circumstances for these scenarios, such as challenges, opponents, or even animals.  These 2 Free Build maps are essentially methods to test out features in the game, given that the tutorial doesn't explain much.  The tutorial does not cover essential parts of the game, which is a real shame considering it would be the perfect place to highlight new features.  Some very important aspects are located in the manual, such as placing braziers near archers will allow them to fire flaming arrows.  That's a pretty useful thing to put in a tutorial.  Combat is largely bugged, as is nearly every other part of the game.  For example, during the first Historical Siege fight, the enemy will show up and begin bashing your ""gate"" down.  Your drawbridge will be lowered, and your gate will be up.  There is no option to raise the drawbridge or lower the gate during the scenario, or vice verse.  However, for all intents and purposes, it is ""closed"" because the enemy will begin bashing the open gate to destroy it.  Bugs and features (skirmish!) aside, there are some fundamental flaws to the game.  The maps are entirely too small for a game about castles and armies.  The quaint graphics are a nice throwback to old gaming styles (classic game-play is one of the allures of this game) but it's time to update it a bit.  The physics are a nice touch, but they pale in comparison to a well designed game!  You can seriously see where there is a square tile of mud or dirt, and then a square tile of green grass next to it!

Through no fault of their own, Amazon provided me with two registration keys that were already used by pirates. Who gave those keys to Amazon? Electronic Arts.

During installation, the game needs a key. After installation, the game tries to tie that key to an EA or Spore account. I tried to register the game with the first key and it said the key was invalid. I contacted Amazon, and they issued me the second key. It was also invalid. When I contacted EA, they told me to login using the email address used to register the keys. The problem was, I hadn't registered it yet, and the email addresses were not mine. EA was not helpful at all.

Instead of requesting more keys, I asked for a resolution from Amazon. They resolved the issue to my satisfaction.

Googling the problem revealed hundreds of people that experienced the same issue. It seems those who buy the game cannot play because someone else has already used the key illegally.

Good Things -
* Some of the puzzles take a little bit of thought to figure them out.
* Pretty pictures and engaging play keeps you interested.

Bad Things -
* Game is very linear.  There is no veering from the track that is set for you.  There are several places where you HAVE TO solve certain puzzles before you are allowed to go on.  However it is often hard to know if you are done investigating or not.
* You HAVE TO play through the whole game even if you figure out the killer halfway through.  GRRR!!!
* Some of the puzzles are infantile in simplicity and some are SO HARD that there is no way to solve w/o downloading the cheat.  This seriously detracts from the game play.
* If you know the book, you know the plot, who did it, and how it's solved.  This fact makes the game play simply a job to get to the end.

I really wanted to like this game, but it's hard.  95% of the game play is just dull plugging and chugging and searching for clues or solving easy puzzles, while the other 5% is impossible - not a great combo.  While I freely admit that you can't expect a game based upon a book to have a plot that's some big surprise, it's basically the DOS ""Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"" game with fancy graphics - exact same linearity and game style.

Unless you have NEVER, EVER read this book/seen the movie, or want to really hope for the best that spending hours in front of the computer doing monotenous searching will give you that special thrill, look somewhere else.

- Awful microphone, sounds like you are talking with the mic in your mouth. Even after an hour of messing with settings, couldn't get rid of the extreme muffling of the voice. best i can describe is it sounds like a charlie brown teacher when you talk.
- They do not fit well, because of the design, the bottom of the earpieces stick out a little and feel weird on your ears.
- While the lights look cool, it is kinda pointless to waste a USB plug for something you can't even see until you take them off

I do not recommend this headset, i have used many headsets in the past (destroyed by dog which is why im in the market) I decided for the price even if it was awful it wasn't that big of a loss, but knowing how terrible the mic is, i don't want anyone else to waste their money either.

I've owned an xbox 360 before but It has not worked for some time now due to the red ring of death. With the new xbox 360 the red ring of death isn't even possible because there in no red led light in it and microsoft has addressed the issue by having the new xbox 360 produce a significantly lower amount of heat inside the hardware. I love the xbox 360, Forza 3, and halo reach (i know its not out yet). I also own a ps3 here is why i like my ps3:
 1)When you save videos on the playstation 3, the video icon is way better. For the ps3 it plays a small loop of the video and its up to you to choose which section of the video to loop. With the xbox 360 there is simply a picture that comes with the video.
 2)When you fast forward videos on the xbox 360 its glitchy and it skips scenes, with the playstation 3 there is a smooth steady flow of the video.
 3)Blu-ray makes the xbox 360 suck, but not too bad because you can download hd videos on the xbox 360 through the xbox live video market place.
 4)You can play online games for free with the 360 you have to pay 50.00 a month some people say your paying for better service, well i played battle field bad company 2 all the time and i never had a slow down so all those people can choke. Lol you think my 1 star will stop people from buying this? NO if you are lazy enough not to read this, you just look at the star rating sorry, here goes

I GIVE THE NEW XBOX 360 A Five 5 Five 5 Star ***** 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 yey

Im giving this a 1 star to make you read my article if i were to give it a 5 star you would not read it because there are so so many. for all of you who complain about my 1 star rating lowering the overall rating i have three words get a life. honestly if that bothers you, you must have a perfect live we have a bad war in afghanistan, politicians who depend on corporations, and an oil spill.

Reasons why I enjoy the 360...
1) 250 gig hard drive verses my 40 gig on the ps3 i know they make better and bigger hard drives with the ps3 but this is my situation.
2)It is so, so, so quiet.
3)Both the ps3 and 360 have wireless internet but the new 360 downloads faster, a lot faster.

You getting a video, cd, a xbox 360 player. With this you will be able to download almost any movie straight from your home into the hard drive of the 360. Same goes with almost any T.V show and music video. Halo Reach is the best thing to happen besides halo 3 and forza 3 I hear mass effect 2 is amazing and gears of war is amazing.

I was hoping for similar entertainment to Cooking Mama, and I did indeed get the same game concept out of this game, just not near the same enjoyment...or any enjoyment...at all.

In Iron Chef you can compete on a career level or quick challenges. You start by selecting your competition (based on difficulty) and then a secret ingredient (in the career mode the secret ingredient is selected for you). Next you create your menu by choosing which dishes you're going to do. Then the challenge begins and you're off performing various cooking tasks such as chopping, grinding, frying, etc...to compose your dishes.

Now, how is this different from Cooking Mama you say? Well, first off, while in the challenge you have no indication whatsoever of what dish you're on. All tasks for each dish are thrown at you in one long sequence. So once you're done chopping onion, you go on to chop more onion, and you may do that two or three times before you get a different task.

Also, the dishes are all the same no matter which secret ingredient you do. I had assumed that each secret ingredient would introduce new dishes, but nope, the dishes are mostly repeated from previous challenges, and they just incorporate the new secret ingredient. For example, in the venison challenge you'll have ""venison hamburgers"" whereas in the boar challenge you'll have ""boar hamburgers"". Same dish, same tasks, different secret ingredient. The game almost seems deceiving stating that there are hundreds of dish variations, but in all actuality the dishes are repeated and it's up to the player to choose which dishes to put on their menu. Within the first three theme ingredients you will have already made the majority of the dishes that the game has to offer.

One thing that drove me crazy about this game was that the movements that you make with your stylus to perform the tasks is never consistent. You could slice perfectly in one task, and do it EXACTLY the same way in the next slicing task and the game tells you you've failed. It's either not calibrated right or the game just randomly selects your achievement of performance. I think it's most likely the prior.

The game does offer goals for which you can earn awards and medals for various achievements, such as performing 50 boiling tasks, or beating the top three career chefs. But I got about halfway through this game and sold it because I was too frustrated with how erratic the game was at scoring my performance.

I really think this game is not worth the money and is a waist of time. There are so many other good cooking-style games for the DS, I encourage anyone considering purchasing this game to select something else.",worst cooking game ever,1238457600,4,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo DS'},

==========
I'm a web developer and gamer. I spend at least 15 hours each day every day on the computer using this product and 2 other Razer products. All three products (including this one) were purchased approximately 2 years ago.

My Relationship with Razer
==========
I was a Razer fanboy when I first got all of three of these products. In hindsight, I was about as stupid as people who blindly buy any Apple product.

All three Razer devices I'm writing about have failed. Using a BestBuy warranty, I have replaced them all at some point or another for failing.

I would NOT anymore recommend Razer products to anyone. I apologize to my friends who I raved about their products to, as now they are experiencing the same issues and terrible products I am.

Razer Lycosa Keyboard [This review] (In trash)
Razer Naga Mouse (In trash)
Razer Carcharias Headset (In trash)

Simple Summary Review - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
This keyboard is a very nice looking keyboard that functions decently as a keyboard. However, considering the premium price, I expect that the advertised features work and that this keyboard, at a minimum, functions as a keyboard should with no unexpected and unbelievably frustrating behavior. Unfortunately, not with this product or brand. After going through 2 keyboards over a period of 2 years, I'm throwing this device in the trash where it belongs. I'll never buy a Razer product again.

Pros - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
 - This keyboard is truly a beautiful piece of plastic. I'm a particular fan of the matte buttons, which are hard to get dirty and easy to clean.
 - It is perfectly visible and usable in completely dark environments.
 - The buttons are very easy to press, leading to less wrist strain over long periods of time.

Cons - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
 - This keyboard has a severe issue of getting stuck signals. It's like a key is stuck, but it's not. The only way to resolve is by unplugging the keyboard. This happens quite regularly, even without using the keyboard at all. I can't count the number of mornings I've woken up, turned on my monitor, only to find my keyboard just a typing an infinitely long Windows password on my locked computer. It's dreadfully annoying in gaming environments. Example: ""Sorry guys, I didn't mean to pull the boss. My keyboard is acting wierd!""
 - The media controller (touchpad) is absolutely useless. I have never gotten it to work, and it always goes crazy. It will regularly turn your volume down. It will constantly flash the keyboard lights. It will always start playing music when you aren't even near your computer. I contacted Razer support, and you know what they suggested? That I put a quarter on it! Yes, it a quarter will completely disable the touchpad. So for the past 2 years, I've been using a quarter to keep my wonky keyboard under my control, sacrificing one of the biggest reasons I wanted the keyboard to begin with.
 - The included USB port doesn't work. The power strength is a fraction of what normal USB ports are from my computer (so charging a phone, for example, takes multiples longer than using a USB port on the back of the computer). In addition, I've yet to get any device to actually function in it. Thumb drives are so convenient to plug in there, but the port simply doesn't work. Yes, I plugged both cables on the keyboard in. It just doesn't work.
 - The lights appear very dull through the buttons. This can be a pro or a con, as the lights shouldn't be distracting. However, I think it's just a little too dull, as it looks like the lights are failing. Pop a key off, though, and it's plain to see that the actual light source underneath is insanely bright.

In Hindsight
==========
I wish I had more nice things to say, but unfortunately, the truth is what it is. I wish I wasn't initially blinded by brand name, and I wish I would have done more research. Unfortunately, the past is the past, and the money spent on these 3 Razer products is lost forever. I hope Razer can fix their products in future generations, but I will never give them another shot. This is a premium product with a premium design. However, the functionality of their devices are equivalent of cheap knock-offs made in China.",Doesn't even deserve 1 star,1316131200,,{'Style:': ' Standard Edition'},

I figured a 007 game with RPG leveling system mechanics should make a great game. I was wrong in the end though. First off I won't go into a full on review because there are a few others that have already done that, I will give you a short reason why I didn't like the game. For positive reviews or pros instead of cons read another review. The main problems i had with the game is that for a stealth game it doesn't take much at all for the enemy to know your exact location. I have had too many times to count where I would be crouched by a crate and aiming in for a headshot and someone across level will see me somehow. Not only that but once they have seen you they always know where you are after that so it becomes a run and gun sort of situation. The AI for the game is also terrible. There are times where to clear a room i use a classic RPG tactic that shouldn't work in this type of game but it does. You know when you are playing your typical RPG game and you see an enemy but to engage in combat you have to touch them and the only way to get a suprise attack is to sneak up on them. Well in those types of games you try to sneak up and if the enemy notices you can walk out of their territory/vision radious and they will go back to their position. Then you sneak up on them and get a surprise attack. Well this same tactic works on this game although there isn't any strategy because you don't have to touch the enemies back to hit them. Walk in the room and let the enemy see you then run out of their radious and they turn around to go back. You simply step out and get your critical hit in the head and they die. There were some times where i would run out of the enemies radious and they would run to a certain point and then just stand there looking at me 5 feet away lol. Then there are some levels where you can sneak all the way through it just to have a heads up firefight with a boss. Let me repeat that. Sneak all the way through for it to be a heads up firefight with the boss. Whats the point? If thats the case why not run and gun on certain levels if it ends the same way. There is no point in reading up on the profiles of enemies because it doesn't increase your chances of winning anymore. There isn't much to the game other than playing through it. All the side items don't matter with all the flaws in the game you could win with the primary pistol doing the tactic stated above. Too many flaws for me and simple tactics exploit the AI and glitches in this game. Its not completely terrible but there are far to many good games out there to play mediocre ones like this. To me there isn't an excuse for the problems i faced while playing it. I think the concept was cool but for the most part the project was rushed. If you liked it good for you but to me its not worth any price because the waste of time playing it when there are other games to play.",Was a good thought but in reality epic fail,1292803200,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

If you still ever play this game, it is a great game, it's 5 stars, provided your into this sort of thing.

But recently when i played the playstation version, i noticed they jibbed out and didn't include certain things that the PC version and better version had.

First off - There is no train. The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure, it may be useless to crash into another train, but it was entertaining. The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet, it has the tracks for it, so go figure that one out.

Next, lack of vehicles. The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.

And something no one can say wouldnt be better... you can edit the PC version, not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself, but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools. You can not just add cars, you can add missions, put more cars into things, edit the exsisting map, or hell, make your own city from scratch.

I got my Logitech GT wheel ready to go but to my utter dissappointment (and disgust), it did not work with this game.  I have half a dozen driving games (like burnout, grid, gt5, dirt 3, etc) and every one of  them works with the wheel.  I cannot even imagine playing a driving game using the ps3 wireless controller.  Well, on this game, I had to use the controller just to see the beautiful city of San Francisco (and I tell you, the wide open city is just breathtaking in this game).  The problem is you can't control the car using a joystick!!!  Anybody who says you don't need the wheel for this game has never used the wheel and thus, they don't know what they're talking about.  Without the GT Wheel support, this game is a lousy game.  Forget all the beautiful scenery...You can't drive with a joystick, period.
It is a terrible omission on the part of the makers of this game.  There is absolutely no excuse for it.  What was that patch the game downloaded?  Another car????  How about a patch to make this game GT Wheel friendly?  None of the 5 star reviews ever mentions the <no wheel support>  Are you out of your freaking minds?

I got this game awhile back and thought it was pretty lame so the game went into retirement, until I decided to pull it out for the first time in many many years and play it and my thoughts remain the same.

For WCW's first video game made during the Monday Night Wars, this was pretty terrible. For starters, this is more of an arcade type of video game then a game you'd expect. The game came out in 1997, yet looks and feels like it was made in 1990, transferred to Playstation discs and called a video game.

WCW vs The World was developed and published by Japanese companies, Asmik Ace Entertainment and The Man Breeze, which would probably explain why there are only 13 WCW wrestlers in the game, while the rest of the roster is fictional Japanese wrestlers. That's right folks. Only 13 WCW wrestlers, while the rest are made-up Japanese wrestlers that have never even remotely been heard of. It's kind of a waste of a game if you're not going to include all of the WCW roster and have a bunch of created wrestlers take up space.

The only arenas you can play in are house show like arenas. There's a WCW house show like arena and the rest are Japanese arenas. To add on to the Japanese theme in this game, there's cheesy music that loops throughout the matches that sounds like it would've been acceptable in a 1980s Japanese action movie. There are 7 different modes you can play in this game that are: League Challenge, Best of Seven, Exhibition Match, Elimination Match, Tournament, League Match, and Double Title Match.

It goes without saying that the move-sets in this game are also very limited. Each wrestler only has about 6 to 7 different moves for you to use until you begin getting bored. Ultimately, once you've played one match, you've played them all. Overall, this game is just horrible. It gets boring within the first 10 minutes before you want to cut it off. A similar WCW game, made and published by the same company would come out later that year; WCW vs NWO: World Tour for the Nintendo 64. It was slightly better than vs The World, but that's not saying much.

Basically if you want to play a better WCW game than vs The World for Playstation, buy Thunder, Nitro, Mayhem, or Backstage Assault. Nitro and Backstage Assault weren't all that good but any following WCW game is 1000x more fun to play than this abomination that is WCW vs The World",Worst WCW Game Ever Made,1402358400,,,

However , i can confirm as of 9/17/15 that this game is playable but extremely dull and boring. The game economy is that of a free to play mobile game and even though i got it dirt cheap , it's a massive waste of $10. But the biggest setback is that you cant start a new game , even if you delete your old save , the game will download your last save from the cloud. So stay away if you like replaying games.

Pros:
1. Amazing Graphics , even though many call it poor optimization the graphics are well ahead of most current games and can run at 30 to 40 FPS on a stock GTX 970.
2. Arno made made me laugh once.

Cons:
1. Boring Story , no where near as good as the previous games. The story stopped making any sense after Assassins Creed 3 but the last installments (Black Flag and Rogue) at least had good game play to compensate.
2. Free to play model game. Ubisoft might as well make this a free game instead if they want to keep this up. Example : Good gear costs around 100,000 to 200,000 and a phantom blade is 1,000 each. Each mission gave me about 500 to 2,000 coins. Good luck if you ever miss your shots which you will since the first five Phantom Blades I got vanished through the same enemy's head. Does it happen all the time ? I don't know since i'm not a ten year old with his mom's credit card. But you're probably thinking GTA Online got away with this. Because GTA Online is actually fun and is accompanied by a single player mode with an exciting story and no in game currency purchases.
3. No replaying the game or starting from scratch. I don't know if this is their way of protecting the in game currency which you have to buy or another bug which got overlooked. Either way . they haven't fixed it as of September 2015 , so most likely they won't fix this. Either way they probably know no one would want to replay this since it's awfully boring.

Further Update: The problem with the touch screen not working seems to be due to the adapter, not the cable, when using the cable with an official charger for either the Vita or the PSP Go it works fine, you just have to deal with the extremely tight fitting connector.

The DS version of Ultimate Alliance 2 has such a narrow character selection that this alone dissuaded me from playing for very long. The graphics were quite terrible for how innovative the console is. A weak port intended as a cash grab that followed the massive marketing campaign this game had. Obviously, the cartridges for the DS have severely limited space compared to disc-based consoles, but the programming must be relatively more difficult since the developers are working with hardware over software; however, I'm no expert on computer science. All in all, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, like it's predecessor, is actually an amazingly stellar game, but do not waste your money on this version, indulge in the Wii version. The nunchaku and motion sensor controls work extremely well with beat-'em-up and hack-'n-slash games like this. Plus, the inclusion of luscious Hi-Def cut-scenes and the entourage of characters MAKE the game. There are a million and one games out there featuring your standard Spiderman and Thor characters, so when I play a game featuring Marvel heroes and heroines, I want to try the less typical ones. Playing as Psylocke or Blade or the Human Torch was much more enjoyable than Iron Man and Wolverine, of whom we see too much of.

So why did I only give it 2 stars if it works perfectly with my mat and wireless controller?
Well it doesn't work with my sony PS2 controllers. I have four sony PS2 controllers and none work fully with this device. I have one controller that came with my slim PS2, two controllers that came with my fat ps2, and one controller that I bought and none of them work fully. The R1 and R2 are not recognized at all and the up directional pad doesn't work on two of the controllers.

Also there is major problem with the drivers. The company that made this doesn't exist anymore. So there really aren't any drivers specifically made for anything beyond windows XP. If you want to find the latest drivers do a google search for dilong 203 drivers but don't use them. Basically I found a guy on stepmania web site that had the drivers up on file hosting site. What happen after installing these drivers was all my fonts got messed up. I'm guessing the drivers were for a Chinese OS. Basically I couldn't read anything on my PC. All texts under my incons were foreign symbols. All text in all texts were foreign symbols. I had to pull out my nexus 7 to search the web for a fix. Basically I ended up using my windows 7 install disc to repair my pc. If you have a system that had windows pre installed and don't have win7 disc you would be in horrible trouble if you didn't make a backup or rescue disc. Before I found a fix I was getting ready to reinstall windows 7.

Now there may be english drivers that won't mess up your pc but it isn't worth the risk looking for them if you ask me. Anyway the basic drivers that come on the disc will let you use a wireless logitech PS2 controller and a redoctane dance mat.  I also tried a guitar that almost worked fully. The only thing that didn't work was the whammy bar.

So if you buy this for mat or wireless ps2 controller make sure to backup the drivers on the disc.  Personally I think you might be better off getting one that is known to work with windows 7 and one that is made by a company that is still in business.

Also note i did try restarting my computer and installing the drivers in windows xp compatibility mode to get the ps2 controllers to work. No dice.

Unfortunately you can't play much of the game without throwing more and more money in to it.  What an obvious and pathetic money grab from Activision!  All of the game is right there on the disc yet if you want to actually play it you must buy figure after figure which are at least $10 a pop an higher.  Also, even though the little USB portal has a certain little cool factor it gets REALLY annoying having to change characters all the time to play certain phases of the game.  Plus, what's going to happen when that little portal ceases to function or the figures no longer register with the portal?  The game will be useless!  But I don't see why Activision felt the need to come up with such a convoluted system.  Oh yeah, money, that's why.  There are also bugs in the program.  If you get to a certain level and talk to a certain character then you must start all over at square one.  Also trying to coordinate the Wii controllers with the characters is very much a juggling act.

Then for some reason they chose to separate the protective plastic into two parts (and not at the halfway point or something, but about 3/5 of the way.)  This means you get it partially down, then have to carefully pry that part out, 100% guaranteeing that dust will get in while you're doing this (law of the universe.  Any delay = dust under protector.)  I've only been installing screen protectors on devices for roughly ten years (I started with PDAs which also had resistive touchscreens) and which apparently isn't long enough because this one managed to confuse me with the backwards design and the split protective plastic on the wrong side.  I've used a lot of screen protectors and modern ones generally are FAR better designed with the protective plastic being the same size as the protector (you don't want it sticking out like this does because it prevents you from keeping it tight against the surface thus allowing more bubbles and dust to get in.)  Call me OCD, but I can't stand it once a speck of dust gets in or when I get those rare few bubbles that no amount of pushing can get out and this one seems to be designed specifically to guarantee this will happen since you have to lift it back up too much to get that other piece out.  As such, my top protector had to be thrown away entirely (unfortunately, the top screen is only protected with a relatively soft plastic, so can scratch too) and the bottom one has several glaringly ugly specks (you don't even have to be OCD for them to bother you) that makes it annoying enough that I WILL have to replace it.

Also, there's only one in the package.  Now, I'll admit it's my mistake failing to notice that it says it only has one and just assuming it's three like all the decent ones in this price range, but at the same time, at this price range there should be three.  If nothing else, there's a very decent chance the user will make a mistake.  I admit it's my mistake for not noticing it wasn't the usual three pack, but it's also their fault for it not BEING a three pack at this price range...

I originally bought a different brand for my 2DS in the past, but I had forgotten what it was (and didn't think I'd have to go through the troubles to dig through my records to find out what it was because from a quick search I thought Hori sounded right since they are such a big brand.)  I've since looked it up and it was iLLumiShield.  They come in a three pack, are cheaper, are very clear, and apply far better.  I'll have to order another as soon as I can't take it anymore, but I've already blown that much on this mistake and I want to at least get some use out of it before I toss it.

I gave this plus one star because if you can somehow apply it perfectly it is pretty good about handling fingerprints.  I subtracted one star because at this price it should be a three pack.  The rest was just due to the all around bad  design.",Bad design abounds...,1417651200,4,,

The core mechanics make the game fun, the visuals and story make it compelling. Skyward Sword is what happens when you have one and not the other.

I have no beef with motion controls, I love Star Fox Zero and my Splatoon game got much better shortly after I switched to gyro aiming. But Skyward Sword feels like a game that was made for a traditional controller and shoehorned for the Wii. It's awkward and indirect. The swordplay was done well, it's pretty cool how some enemies and elements only respond correctly to being slashed in a particular direction, but everything else is a chore. It's a constant nag that, no, you can't do this the way that feels natural.

I came in expecting a learning curve, but this is a mess. It's the only major Zelda title I hadn't played and I hoped to do so before Breath of the Wild, but I think I'll wait for an HD remake.

On that note, too, the visuals are strangely fuzzy. I played Twilight Princess on the Gamecube and thought it was beautiful, so I'm not sure why they made it look this way.

  The game costs $60 and it has almost no content. When the game first came out they said that they would add new content every so often in updates and that was true. They did add new content but the content they added was just weapons. NOT EVEN NEW WEAPONS, the weapons they added are just clones of the first few weapons but with tiny stat changes and a new name on the front like, ""custom"" or ""deco"" but in reality it is just the same weapon. They have added new maps to play on in the update, but you can't only play 2 different maps for 3 hours before they change them, this makes the game get boring very fast. The game does have a one player story mode but after the first few levels all of the levels after them were basically the same. There weren't that many levels and they all took me about 1 minute to complete.

  Turf wars are a fun mode where 4 players compete against 4 other players to see who can cover the ground with the most ink. You start out at level 1 and you usually play with people up to level 10 or less. Once you hit level 4 your released from your protection, you start playing with people up to level 50. There is pretty much nobody who is around your level and most people you play with are between level 40 and 50. You are still limited to what guns and gear you can have so you end up being ambushed and killed by level 50's looking for an easy kill. It's like players that are level 50 have run all the newcomers out. There is another option you can play ranked battle where you only play people that are your rank. The downside is that when you lose the match you lose points. If you lose a certain amount a points your rank goes down. That it fair to me, but even if you get a connection error that has nothing to do with your internet you still lose points towards your rank.

  The connection errors are frequent and very annoying. Every time there is an error it blames you for your internet connections and then will not let you join another battle. I noticed that the connection errors usually happen with 5-10 seconds left in the match when you are about to get you reward. If you are in ranked battles when this happen you automatically lose points. At first I thought it really was my internet but then quickly realized that my other games that use internet work just fine without problems. When ever there is a connection error I have to turn my system off and on again and wait for the game to load.

CONS:
-The passing is atrocious. It often goes completely in another direction.

-Your AI players are useless. Complete idiots who skate right into you.(Even in Superstar difficulty)  Defense-men let skaters just blow past them. Yep. Just keep skating backwards and do nothing to stop them. They will crash into your goalie and cost you goals and games.

 -Player switch is awful, and is completely random. I've given up easy crap goals due to this issue, as your AI defense men do absolutely nothing. AI players will completely let passes just go right by them, or head to the bench unexpectedly as you pass towards them.

-Puck pickups are god awful. You can flatten a guy and he still has enough time to get up and regain possession. This his also cost me plenty of breakaway opportunities and gotten me scored on.

-It's WAY too easy to lose the puck. Opposing skaters don't even need to poke check you. As long as they're anywhere near you, you lose the puck and they gain possession

-CPU is way overpowered. The momentum system in this game is insane. If they have the puck and you're down or up by a goal or two the AI has no problem roaring back. Expect to get scored on with half a second often from the strangest angles. Think the Karlsson goal on Henrik. -Scrub goalies like Greiss and Mrazek can absolutely rob you consistently while your goalie lets in everything and everything. This applies more to HUT. I find my goalie performs as he should in Franchise, but in HUT they are awful. Their rating doesn't matter. Especially after 20 games or so. They let everything in. Expect your stick to break or to whiff a shot when up by one or two late in the game. It never ceases to amaze me.

-Whiffed shots. So many whiffed shots. Why? Why is 97 Heatley, 94 Rob Blake, 99 McDavid etc whiffing on wide open one timers and slapshots so frequently?

-Slingshotting. Every now and then players will slingshot across the ice, as well as the puck. Why? How lazy are these guys?

- Menus. So many damn menus. Plus they're really slow.

- Music. Most of it is just god awful. And there's no option to turn off certain tracks. Again, why?

- Many star players aren't face scanned or haven't been updated in ages/have the same player photo since NHL 15.

-Crowd doesn't react appropriately most of the time, nor is attendance realistic. Why do the Panthers play to sold out crowds every time I face them?

-Commentary is awful and lazy. Players are often referred to as ""the shooter"" and teams as the ""away team"" and ""home team"". There are audio discrepancies in which certain pieces were recorded lower. Just very boring commentary. Doesn't feel like an NHL game, especially in the playoffs. There's just no excitement.

- Be a Pro is awful and boring. Nothing happens. You can score 50 goals in a season and get 2 contract offers for 1.5 million because you're an 81 overall. lol

-Celebrations are horrible. Just look at them. Stiff like robots. Player facial expressions are robotic. They showed more emotion in 15.

Pros
-Tie ups. Pretty neat addition and helps defend against one timers

-The crowd goes nuts with a late important goal, accompanied by camera shake. Neat!

-You can relocate in Franchise. Kinda cool if you want to bring back the Whalers.

That's about it for the Pro's. This game is god awful. Stay away unless you want to be filled with rage just about every time you play. Hopefully 18 is better.

Just make sure to do it now, though -- if you hold onto the game for over a week, I think you're out of luck.

Now let's say you're a poor sap who bought the game from the SimCity website directly. I feel your pain. And their customer service is legendarily poor (sidebar: I remember getting into it with one of their reps about my Rock Band 2 equipment that broke EXACTLY three months after I bought it. It was unreal.) -- there have been multiple reports of being threatened with a total account ban if you dare dispute their refund policy.

So this is what it comes down to: dispute it on your credit card or through your bank. (or through Paypal, but that will take a much longer time and be a bigger pain in the butt) I disputed through Chase and there wasn't a problem -- they give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're telling the truth about what happened -- then they investigate your claim and make their decision. I don't think I've ever had a dispute of mine turned down, because they've all come down to this basic idea: you're not getting what you paid for.

1.0,False,"03 8, 2011",A2ES3UI6X9QWLJ,B0047TLIBU,Bobby Findlay,"* Tentative review and FYI:

Well, I've just about had it with working with this gaming just to get it work.  I've invested probably 4 hours total now on and off trying to get this game to even do it's most basic function: run.  I have a non-cracked, perfect order ps3 with an internet connection, etc.  The game will boot up to the main menu, where I can tool with ""options, extras, downloadable content"" just fine, but once I touch ""New Game"" the game hangs at the loading screen.  Apparently this is not something I am alone with, with Bioware's message board filled with advice such as ""delete your old DA:O files, and maybe your old ME2 files as well.  Having more saves from DA:O could cause extra load time.""

Obviously not a good solution.  So I reinstalled the game data, ran the game, nothing.  Game still hangs at ""Run Game"".  So, I then tooled with what would work - i ""DISCONNECTED"" from EA's servers and got it to work, finally.  After making it through the first, maybe 15 minutes, the game froze.  This was due to my settings going to default, and auto connecting to EA's servers.  After this incident, the game now refuses to load or use the new game function again, despite what I do.

Well than I gave deleting old ME2 and DA:EU stuff off my ps3 may actually help, so I did so, and left only what I really wanted anyway in the form of saves.  Boot up the game, turn off EA servers, and then play the next 30 minutes of the game.. where it freezes again, for no reason.

I have an open ticket with EA for support, but apparently I am not alone in this boat by a long shot.  In this generation of gaming, you honestly cannot be coming out with console games that do not work, especially the signature versions. Essentially, if this game will not work, I am stuck with a very much devalued signature edition due to downloading my DA:2 EA PASS, which ultimately seems to be the cause of these issues.

EDIT: To those of you thinking this review is not a reiview because you assume I have no played through this game yet, pelease read my following response:

""I have played the game on the PC - I am on my second play through. First as a rouge on casual and now as a mage on hard. I'd still give the game a disappointing 65/100 for a multitude of reasons - but that belongs in the PC thread, not the PS3 one. I will bet you EA will have you shelling out at least 100$ for the game and all the decent DLC if you have the regular version - most of which is ALREADY ON THE FRIGGIN DISK!! (Paid 20$ for DLC for PC and 60$ on steam, so already 80$).

The PS3 is, thus, a game worthy of a 1/10. This is different the the PC game. I have owned nearly every bioware game on generally multiple consoles (ME1 on 360 and PC, ME on 360, PC, and PS3, DA:O on 360, DA:EU on PC and PS3, DA2 on Steam (PC) and PS3 - along with KOTOR 1 and 2 on Xbox and PC, and many others, even the failed MMO Warhammer).

So, as it stands, this is a legitimate review as this version has NO CONTENT and therefore is a horrible ""game"", but just a menu. I highly recommend the PC version and not the PS3 version and that was a main reason for writing this review.""

Aside from the need for loading Origin first, the game doesn't even launch then, but instead opens up options in a browser window.  It's extremely frustrating and difficult to find many basic options.  As well, searching for any kind of game will randomly choose a server, even if it's using an expansion pack you don't have.  You can't join it, it just brings a popup telling you to buy the expansion pack, and can happen many times in a row when searching for servers.

Once you actually pick a server, there's a severely long wait time to load up.  People say there's very little wait time if you have a solid state hard drive, but this extremely long wait time is inexcusable.  My computer settings are such that I can run everything on high settings as perfectly as a console.

Adding on to that, unlockables are extremely difficult to get---I've put in at least 2-3 hours of average gameplay in and not unlocked a single thing yet.  By that point in Battlefield 3, I'd at least unlocked the next level weapons in Assault and Engineer kit.  It's a seemingly callous ploy to get you to pay more money to get all the unlockables instantly.

As for the maps; except for Siege of Shanghai, they're unimpressive and overall dull.  The environment destruction is essentially unchanged from Battlefield 3, with greater level destruction either inconsistent or only working when you use tank shells, as rocket launchers and grenades are useless for bringing down pieces of structures.

The temptation to just uninstall this and go back to Battlefield 3 is all the more tempting given that the game looks exactly the same.  Even Call of Duty games change up the user interface/HUD and the font between each game---this one doesn't even do that.

1.0,True,"07 12, 2014",A2WB7LZ595CR50,B00BGA9YZK,J,"Sadly, I knew from the opening sequence that this game wasn't going to be very good.  I had high expectations that were not only not met but actually dashed to bits.  In a nutshell, this game stinks.

First is the environment.  Forget the lush visuals of the trailers and promos. at least 80% of the game will be spent in dark rooms, hallways, corridors, outer space, spacecraft, vent shafts and other drab environments.  Second, the navigation stinks.  The navigation and objective markers are very confusing at times. And that's only when the directional objective marker actually feels like appearing (there were several times I tried to invoke it, only to get a text display of my objective and nothing more).  It can be more confusing than helpful at times, especially when it rotates 360 degrees, like when you're in outer space, zero gravity or on a multi-level structure.  And some of the mission objectives are just downright confusing.  You'll get a vague hint like ""assist so and so"" but it doesn't tell you that this assistance involves several steps that aren't very intuitive.

The weapons for the most part are decent but there are major shortcomings.  For instance, the game loves to put you in rooms full of ammunition and weapons like you're in a candy store but you can only carry a ridiculously small supply. You get one primary weapon, one secondary and a max capacity refill of reach. There are two types of grenades but you can only carry one type at a time.  When you're looking at a weapon on the ground, you can see the specs for it but the lame comparison leaves a lot to be desired.  Instead of orange and green bars to indicate more or less power, just do a side by side.  The worst glitch with the weapons is that some of them will simply refuse stop working and refuse to fire.  There is no explanation, no little text message to say ""too close to target"" an indication that the weapon is empty or anything.  Nope, you just sit there pressing R2 like a maniac while getting riddled by the enemy.  As if ridiculous cheapness were';t enough, the AI enemies even do little victory dances over your body and take cell phone pics of their kill.  So after the game fails on you, it celebrates its failure in tacky fashion.

There are adrenaline packs that you can use during battle.  They will restore your health and also give you a temporary slowed down Matrix style ""bullet time"" boost.  It's helpful when facing a few enemies but pretty much useless when needed most, against scores of enemies as you'll encounter in the latter stages of the game.  Like the weapons, they also seem to disappear without warning when you need them most.  I'll start a new section with a full supply of adrenaline packs but somehow go down and see the message ""no adrenaline packs available"".

The tactical echo and O.W.L. were the only two things that really stood out about the game and even they had their faults.  They are usually excellent tools in your arsenal, especially for helping  deal with the darker environments.  The tactical echo acts almost like a heat sensor, displaying enemy silhouettes through walls, doors or floors.  The O.W.L. is your personal drone that is capable of providing a shield, attacking enemies, disabling enemy shields and hacking computer systems which accomplishes numerous objectives like disabling alarms, opening doors, navigating ships, disabling security systems, etc. Unfortunately, when you use the most useful features like shield and pulse, it quickly drains the O.W.L. and it will end up off in a corner recharging when you really need it.  Also, as far as engagement, although it occasionally kills enemies, (more in the beginning than latter stages), by the last few chapters of the game, it amounts to little more than a distraction and hacking device.  99% of the enemies will need to be dispatched by you.

All in all, I played the game only because I paid for it. I can wholeheartedly say if this were offered free as a PS-Plus game of the month or some other deal, I likely would have deleted it by now.  I would not buy the game again if given the chance all over again, but everyone has different tastes.  My advice is to watch a couple play through videos online just to get a grasp of the environment you'll actually be playing in versus the much prettier environments shown in the ads.  Might not hurt to rent it first as well, if you're able to do so.  Otherwise, grab it in a bargain bin as cheap as possible or wait to see if Sony offers it as a free PS plus game (highly likely in the near future) if you simply must have it.

However, if frequently getting lost in dark environments with malfunctioning weapons and vague directives while having enemies twerk over your body and take cell phone pics after a ridiculously cheap kill seems like fun, then dive on in.

The uppercut move when I first got the joystick was flawless.  Then all of a sudden it stopped working.  That's right; it just stopped registering also.  WTF???

I have concluded that the contacts in the joystick are so cheap that they are shifting thus making the ability to replicate moves impossible.  Which makes the joystick worthless.

Oh and setup was a tad of a pain.  But I wouldn't have docked it points if the controller was decent.  But pain in the ass setup for mediocre game play is terrible.

1.0,True,"10 28, 2015",A1YRSKMPJ9K24,B013HSWF40,Chris,"Let me begin by saying that I've owned several gaming mouse, from the Logitech MX Performance to the G700s, from a Roccat, Zowie, fierce gaming no brand mouse to a Steelseries sensei wired and have also owned the best Mousepads in the market, Destructor II, Manticor, Steelseries DeX, Artisan Shidenkai MID.

I bought this mouse to replace my sensei which I loved, I planned to buy the Sensei Wireless because I loved my normal sensei so it was the logical upgrade, sadly I'm regretting my decision of buying this Mamba because the jumbo mumbo marketing and the shouts of ""The most advanced gaming mouse"", I even shrug to the thought that people really as aid that, I will be returning it soon if a friend of mine don't agree to buy it since its new and perfectly working... At least it is working as ""Intended"", at least that's what the almost inexistent Razer customer support says.

Let me begins with the Pros, as this mouse might be suitable for you buts it's a nightmare for me.

Pros:

-The shape is good for a palm grip like a G700s but without the strange ""ergonomic feeling"" of a fat ass mouse, some reviewers said that the mouse can also work with a fingertip grip which is my main grip, this is bollocks, that's like saying the Razer Orochi works for Palm grips

- The lights are cute, but that's all, RGBs are RGBs and nothing more, they're nice to have but only if they come without compromises, in this case it might be a compromise as they drain the battery faster, in my tests the highest brightness setting can reduce up to 2.5 hours of its 12--14 hours battery life at 1000Hz ultra polling rate and 1800 DPI

-I'll put the wireless here because it's wireless and that's a plus.

Cons:
- The wireless suck, I have to put the receiver next to the mouse, I can't even take them 2 feels a part or the stuttering begins, before you call out my wifi channel settings, Ive been there and changed my channels from 1 to 11 to no avail, so that's not the issue.

- The settings and the software are broken, the liftoff distance does nothing, the 10 acceleration levels do nothing at all, only the 0 works which is disabled, if you use any setting from 1 to 10 they're all the same, the software is broken even months ahead of release...

- The calibration settings doesn't work, I have a destructor II and choose that profile but when it is enabled the mouse jitters for some reason so I had to disable it.

-the ""click force"" configuration of the buttons are useless, if you use the lowest settings the clicks don't return to their unclicked position as they should, have you ever had an old keyboard which keys stay pushed down after you pushed them once? Yes, that's how these clicks work with the lowest force setting applied, I ended up using a middle setting.

- The input lag, it's huge, my sensei got all acceleration levels working without any input lag, but the mamba 2015 it's worthless, as I said before acceleration levels don't do anything, the software got from 1 to 10 and a 0 for disabled, the only setting that works is 1 or 0, any other setting do the same as 1 with no difference, broken, but the biggest issue is the input lag when activating acceleration, it's very noticeable, 10 times more noticeable than my sensei wired.

I understand that turning acceleration creates extra input lag for the algorithm trying to figure the acceleration out, but trust me, this is ridiculous, the amount of input lag of this mamba is 10 times higher than my sensei at the same setting.

-Did I say the software is worthless? Because it is, you can't use this mouse without the software, forget about the ""plug n play"" that Razer says, this mouse doesn't have onboard memory therefore you need to use the software 100% of the time otherwise the mouse behave like a cheapo wireless 10$ Mouse, that'd not be a problem IF the software actually worked, it crashes every time and you can't open the damn thing from the task bar, and when it finally opens its absolutely sluggish and crashes every time, if you want a workaround this you have to disable multiple profiles and have only 1, otherwise the lag and crashes for some reason becomes unbearable,the fact that a 150$ mouse doesn't ave onboard memory is insulting enough, but that it doesn't have properly working software? I don't know what to say, add on top that the software itself is some kind of DRM like UPlay, Origin or Steam, except this DRM is there just for the laughs because reasons, you can't use the software of you're offline.

For the most expensive mouse in history this is absolutely unacceptable, a piece of junk, even if it was only 30$ I'd still return it because half the time I can't even use the damn thing and I preffer my 60$ sensei in every way because it just works on hardware and software level, unlike this mamba.

My wife likes games that are easy to understand, not too challenging, easy to play/win and fun enough to keep her interested for 45 minutes to an hour, at which point she usually gets distracted by something else.

Me, I can play games for hours.  I want a game that's difficult, challenging, and unique.  I like games that make me think, and challenges me to find new ways to complete tasks.

NEITHER of us liked Winter Sports on the Wii.  The controls are completely senseless, and have no relation to the task at hand, spare possibility the luge/skeleton/bobsled games which require nothing more than tilting a controller to keep the craft centered on the track.  The controls for speed skating made no sense whatsoever, and the curling controls were, in a word, stupid.  The controls for ice skating were so frustrating that we only played it once!  They simply had you jerking on the Wii controller and nunchuk attachment when icons for the two controllers reach a circle at the bottom of the screen.  The problem was, we could never get the controller to read accurately, and felt like there was a literal 1/10th second gap of opportunity to register the movement.  Very, very frustrating.

The other various subgames give you instructions on how to control the sport, but no indication of how to reach success in the game.  For example, it took a few passes down the bobsled track before we realized that you wanted to aim your craft for these light-colored strips impossed in the ice while a ""success bar"" would fill at the bottom, indication successful completion of each turn.  If we had been instructed in this method before our first time down the track, it probably wouldn't have been so frustrating.

The graphics look nice until you realize that there's little intelligence behind it.  During a two-player, speed-skating challenge, I pressed the Ready button, and both character figures on my split screen took a launch stance at the starting line.  My wife had not pressed the Ready button yet, and so both of the character figures on her split screen were still stretching.

I asked them if early PS2 consoles produced in 2000 don't work with their product. Both sides say they cannot be certain, but there is a possibility since they did design the product based on a later produced PS2 console. The funny thing is, UK support asked me to contact SCEA to see if there was any hardware changes made in the PS2 production over the years. Why waste my time? I just returned this product. My recommendation is to purchase this product at a store that guarantees returns so you can test it on your console and return it without any hassle if it doesn't work.

1.0,True,"09 2, 2004",AT576Z9DC6HJ0,B00007KQC5,D. K. Malone,"First off: The Gamecube ports of RE2, RE3 and RE Code Veronica are not meant for vets who played them already on Playstation or Dreamcast. These are for newcomers to the series, Gamecube owners who started off with the REmake and RE0. Ignorant vets will be disappointed at the lack of new content.

I became an RE fan in the spring of 1996 when the first game in the series was new. I loved it and I couldn't wait for the sequel. When RE2 was finally announced, many fans were disappointed that it had two entirely new characters instead of reusing the characters from the first game. The director explained that every RE game had to have new characters, because the previous characters had already been through their share of horrors and were now hardened by them. I agreed with him 100%. So later when RE3 was announced and Jill from RE1 was the main character, that seeded my disdain for the game. It disappointed me that the creator didn't have the balls to stick to his guns, because he was right. Later I came to accept the rehashing of previous characters in RE games, but this was the first one to do it, and it annoyed me.

Eventually the game came out and I bought it. Another irking detail niggled me right out the gate; RE3 has no ""normal"" difficulty setting, which is what I always play my games on when given the choice. In this game, you have to choose between easy or hard. Easy is insultingly easy and hard is harder than I like. However, RE3 does have some great gameplay innovations such as the gunpowder based ammo creation system, and the defensive dodge move, which I really wished they'd put into all following games in the series. There are also several points where you have to choose between two possible actions, and the choice you make does have an effect on what happens next. The puzzles are fairly standard for an RE game.

RE3 does nothing to further the storyline. It's a complete sidetrack. I've always personally considered Code Veronica to be the true sequel to RE2, and RE3 to be a 'gaiden' (sidestory). Recently it's come out that this is the official truth, and the only reason Code Veronica wasn't given the title RE3 was because of the business relationship (or perhaps even actual contractual obligations) between Capcom and Sony. In some cases I would argue that if the gameplay itself is good, the story doesn't matter. But the fact is, RE1 set up Umbrella as the ultimate evil jerks who needed to be taken out, and RE2 did precious little to bring us closer to that goal. By the end of RE3, you're in exactly the same place RE2 left you, no closer to taking down the bad guys. Code Veronica, on the other hand, does indeed finally take the fight directly to Umbrella. And while I'm on the subject, I really have to question the wisdom of having RE4 take place in a world where Umbrella has already been taken out completely. That's one pleasure that DEFINITELY should have been given to the player.

To sum up: I'm an RE vet of eight years and I don't recommend RE3.",Can't recommend this one,1094083200,5,{'Platform:': ' GameCube'},

I was very excited when this game came out.  After buying it and trying it out for 3 hours, I was so dissappointed and had to trade the game in (got less than 1/2 of the price I paid for).

Basically, the game has very little leagues you could pick and choose.  I don't have to say more about this weakness because you would spot the same complaint from the other reviewers.  Some people said the graphic is great, I would disagree.  Comparing with the last Fifa game (2006 World Cup Fifa), I think the graphic of this game is a lot worse.  Plus, in this game you don't have many different camera viewing options.

It was claimed that this game was designed with the new engine offering many new and different features.  For instance, it tried to show the realism of the game by allowing the players ""bumping"" into each other.  I think it is ridiculous!  Overall, comparing with the ""2006 World Cup Fifa"", this game is really bad!

I have read many other reviews about this game (after buying it!!! - I know, it's a mistake.  I thought I would love it regardless what other people said and I finally regretted) and I totally agree with most of them after playing it.

I was sorely disappointed by this game! From the opening cinematic I was appalled by the weak, PS2 reminiscent graphics. Some of the worst cutscenes on a gen3 game. Yes, your character has some cool moves but when is sliding across a room full of bad guys in slow motion profitable when you only kill two? The platforming and aiming mechanism are weak. Also, the so-called ""upgrades"" that you can purchase should have been gimmes to start with!
The graphics are mediocre at best and the controls are just awful.
This is a PS3 game...so what is up with the crappy graphics. I knew the graphics wouldn't be as sweet as the cover of the box but I didn't imagine they would be as bad as they are. If you have played Infamous or Uncharted 2 then you are aware of the PS3's graphics potential...WET takes advantage of maybe 0.5% of the potential.

They really phoned this one in. It's frustrating because it looks great and plays so well. The problem and it is a HUGE one, is that on 150cc races against the ai, you can go the whole race and get hit a normal amount by the other racers. As soon as you are in first place and about 100-200 feet away from the finish line on the last lap, you will get hit repeatedly and often get knocked down to about 5th place.
There is an item you can get that nullifies an attack, but you rarely get it, and it's good for one attack against you. The problem is, they designed the ai in a way that forces people to play nintendos way to win. You have to sit back from the front until the last lap and then make your way to the front to consistently finish in the place you could have easily reached in the first lap.
Mario kart fans or not, I truly don't understand how so many people can overlook such a gigantic flaw.
I understand the game is big for parties and whatnot, but not everyone wants to play multiplayer all the time. They have gone the same route as other ""next gen"" titles by forcing you into playing multiplayer. Don't get me wrong, you can play the game and beat it against the ai, it's just so predictable when you will get hit, that you feel like if you want your monies worth, you need to play against actual people.
It's 2014, how has the computer become more predictable in this series?
I am not a mario kart fan boy. I bought a wii u recently and got mario kart 8 thinking it would be a great buy and a good time to delve into this cool little world. If you are not currently a major fan of mario kart games, look somewhere else. This game will NOT be worth 30$ unless you want to play multiplayer. If you pay more than 30$, seriously reconsider unless you have mario sheets and a yoshi bed spread.
This game is probably the best transforming racing game out there right now, but I would suggest looking into the sonic transforming game over this one.

YouTube, what a worthless update. nothing but problems

UPDATE: this console is a complete piece of TRASH, it's completely Almost Bricked itself 2x I had to do a full reset a second time the console locked up again at 74% update.

This concsole selling point is the HDR feature to which PS4 has just announced hat all 40millions play stations 4 are getting a firmware update this year and will fully support HDR 4K televisions. another knife in microsofts back, Not to mention PlayStation 4 Pro is being sold at a shocking 399.00 and reseal sea this November

Firstly I was excited about the release of this update, it looks more modernized and the fact that it has a UHD Bluray player was a bonus since I already have an UHD Tv and was looking at the Samsung UHD Blueray player which by itself is 300.00? however I'm severely underwhelmed with the update? I thought the user interface would be more snappy, it still hangs here and there much like the current Xbox one, I thought it was going to update everything to 4K as claimed however from my understanding all it's doing is updating games to display the brighter colors and darker hues which benefits the new technologies of some UHD tvs  to which my 6,000 Samsung doesn't have? I have the 75""  JU7000FXZA which is an 8-bit set. When u go to 4K in the system it says my tv is 4K 60hz and everything else is red including playing games in 4K and playing movies in 4K?

My nvidia shield is better than this thing, keep your current gen Xbox one and wait for next years.

I purchased 4 UHD Bluray movies and was also not overly impressed with the quality? I have the Samsung UHD Harddrive with 30 movies and the quality from the drive is significantly better than the bluray UHD? I do not understand why! I don't know if it has to do with the quality of the UHD Player in the system the only way to really tell would be to purchase the Samsung UHD Player. All I'm saying your not gonna get any benefit from upgrading? 8it has a 7% FPs increase in GPU performance? Not impressed with UHD bluray, and overal performance is disappointing? Wait for next years new update

After further testing I'm still not impressed 4x I've had complete system lock ups forcing me to do a hard reset, the UHD Bluray isn't all it's shaped up to be as the Samsung hard drive out shines the disc in all aspects I've had 6 people compare the two Video qualities

1.0,True,"11 18, 2009",A4F881WOJ5TJ8,B00166N6SA,Deestarr1,"Some of you might be wondering why I am giving this game such a bad review. I have been playing the Sims games since the first games in the franchise beginning with games like Sim Tower, Sim Farm and the first The Sims game came out between 1990 and 2000, and to be clear other than in the sheer quality of the game I am not comparing it to any of them.

Initially I liked this game. The traits helped me create quirky Sims and the open neighborhood was great. I was less than impressed with some of the graphics- lets be realistic while the hood may be great even with a great graphics card mine is a top of the line Nvidia G Series - (one of the best listed in the Specs for the G Series, and I have a 500 GB hard drive, and 4 GB RAM and a 17 inch monitor so that is not the issue) and all my settings on high, the Sims themselves are not so great.

Than EA released their first patch 1.27. At this point I was playing without Mods or CC because there wasn't much out there frankly. The patch was supposed to deal with some issues like the Story Progression that was broken in base game and disappearing inventory items. It didn't, I had to reinstall my game. This pattern has continued throughout patches 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5/1.6.

Recently I purchased World Adventures, removed all my CC and Mods (what few I use cause I don't like cheating) deleted cache files, etc Standard Operating Procedure for installing patches and Expansions in games where there are fan created content and game modifications available. I go to start up the game- patched, newly installed EP, and absolutely no CC/Mods whatsoever, and my lots have disappeared and turned blue, all premade Sims are now homeless, and my Sims cannot interact with NPC""s, premades, or each other. They also cannot go to work, and all car pools and taxis have disappeared.

I tried uninstalling both the base game and World Adventures and putting the last patch to remotely work (1.3) in place for my game and started up the game again with no CC/Mods- which resulted in my not being able to save at all or to use CAS to make Sims, or to access premade Sims on their lots in order to play them. These issues were reported to EA customer service who told me that I needed a better computer ( uhmm well there isn't much better I could get unless I went out a bought a $6000 computer with my own server to boot). Sorry EA the problems with this game are your fail - not mine.

I uninstalled. I will not be reinstalling.

Let me put this simply. This game is poor quality. I never had this type of problems with either Sims 1 or Sims 2, with any of the Expansion or Stuff Packs, or with any of the patches. I will not purchase any further expansions or stuff packs for Sims 3. I also will not be buying any of Electronic Arts other games.

The bad is much longer, The respawn system in TDM is broken and will spawn you in front of enemy players only to be killed and again respawned in front of another enemy player. Lag is rampant in this game so much more than in BF4 and you will constantly be killed after running several feet behind cover. This game also still experiences the 0 health kill that BF4 has, matter in fact all the small issues that BF4 has right now are actually in this game too. The guns feel wrong compared to BF4, I can't explain it exactly but a gun like the p90 feels more controllable in BF4 than in Hardline and the bullet spread more predictable, you may like this but I didn't. The maps aren't very well thought out and will be one sided based on certain game modes, also the environments are less destructible which I feel is the worse thing about this game. The weapons list per class is very small, around 5-6 and vehicles... what vehicles? There are cars and such but they aren't worth using unless you need to cross the map in a hurry and if your good with the helicopter (BF4 veterans usually are) then you'll be a god since there isn't a simple way to knock the helicopter down when your on foot.

From what I can tell this game looks like it should have been an expansion like BF Vietnam was for BF BC2 on ps3. I don't understand why DICE thought Hardline was a good enough game that it could stand on its own but it can't. It's an ok game and I think if you can get it for $20-$25 it would be worth it but for $40-$60, ehhh borrow it from a friend who has lost interest in it.

I am not the type that looks at these ""out of game"" extras as a good deal. I have too much stuff in my apartment as it is. If you do like this stuff though, you get a reasonable amount for the extra $30.  That is an end user decision.

Now the base game:

One of my friends picked up a copy of Spore.  I had not really intended to buy any games at the present due to the lack of time to play them with some others on the horizon when I will have time.  Anyway, I got to sit down and play my friend's copy (On his computer if you must know) for a bit. I won't be picking up a copy at initial retail price and here is why.

So, the game is fun at first.  I had a blast with the creature creator and creating things in this game is one of it's highlights.  The graphics are very pleasing and the creatures themselves are the best part of the game.  As others have said the hype and promises of this game over the last few years set up for a big disappointment.  I guess I was just hoping for something different.  Certain stages of the game are too quick.  Perhaps patches in the future (likely purchased add-ons from looking at the Sims) will make Spore what it should have been from day 1, but as of now, this game just isn't worth full retail price.  I bet I'd get about 12 gaming days out of it before I was bored.  Maybe a month of real time.

The game of Spore would get a 3 out of 5 alone.  Not the best game of the year, but definitely not the worst.  Then again I wasn't a huge fan of The Sims either, so maybe die-hard Sims fans will get more enjoyment.

There are a multitude of professional review sites that mirror what I am saying.  Spore could have been, and may be in the future a revolutionary game. As it is now, it fell short.

Onto the package as a whole:
A quick net search will show many articles at reputable sites about the DRM in this game.  It is exactly the same as Mass Effect which I experienced first hand and not just on a friend's computer.  SecuROM installs itself without any warning on the box, EULA, or install prompts.  What's more is that it won't uninstall when you uninstall the game.  You need to net search to figure out how to get rid of it.  SecuROM is there to gather info about your computer to look for hardware changes and then decrement your install limit.

In addition to the required Spyware you have a 3 activation limit.  This may seem okay until you actually look at what triggers an activation.  Things verified by users and EA themselves that trigger installs include.
1.) Any hardware change inside your computer.
2.) USB hardware changes.  Change your printer or get external HD..too bad.
3.) Formatting your disk. So if SecuROM itself causes issues with old versions of SecuROM which it has been known to do and you need to reinstall windows on the EXACT SAME hardware then you use up an activation.
4.) Putting a copy on your laptop to play on the road.
5.) Getting a new PC.

Uninstalling the game will not give you activations back like when you deauthorize iTunes on a PC.  As you can see it can be easy for users to eat up those installs.  In the world of PCs you never know when you may get a virus, have a hardware failure, or just want to upgrade your system.

If you do use up the 3 activations you can call EA and get more.  While this may be okay if you get free long distance, if you don't or live overseas then expect to pay the full price of the game again just to be able to reinstall.  As of now there are no international activation lines.

Lastly, Spore is a game that people of all ages could enjoy.  The issue is that your activation code is LOCKED to an account.  So if you install it on your computer, all users of that computer need to log into the same account for the online content.  People do not get their own world for creature creation.

So EA locks your key to your account and then limits the number of times you can reactivate the product.  They claim on their site that you can install it on multiple computers and not need the CD...they fail to tell you that you can't have multiple accounts.  You think they could at least give 1 per activation.  What's more is that the manual itself says you can have as many user worlds as you like, but then EA just released that this was a ""typo"".

Anyway, Spore went from a very promising game that could have been revolutionary enough to revive the dying PC Gaming market.  Instead it came up short of it's expectations and threw in spyware and unnecessary limitations that really do affect the end user.  If you are the type that never reinstalls old games and does not care about extra processes on your computer gathering info and sending it to some company then by all means enjoy Spore.  If you are like me though and frequently upgrade hardware, play old games every so often, and just plain don't like extra unneeded things running on your PC then look elsewhere.",What could have been great wasn't.,1221177600,10,"{'Edition:': ' Galactic', 'Platform:': ' PC/Mac'}",

I have been a fan of Resident Evil since the first game, which means all the stuff everyone complained about - the 'bad controls', the 'bad camera angles', the 'inventory games', and so on - were all things that made the game work for me. That is, I liked the concept as it was.

When RE4 was announced I had some concerns, particularly when we found out that the original design was an update of the existing formula with better graphics and controls. But I gave it a chance and found it to still be a fun game (although not by any constructive means a Resident Evil game). So even after hearing all the bad news about RE5 I kept my mind open and gave it a chance.

But this game is just atrocious. The fundamental problem is that the designers obviously do not want to make the old-style RE games. They want to keep pushing the series towards a straight third-person action-shooter incarnation but they are unwilling to make a clean break. So what you're left with is a hodgepodge of old and new whose sum is somehow worse than its parts. All of the old complaints are still there: clunky motion, can't shoot while moving, crap inventory and inventory management, confusing and difficult gun/ammo interaction, the whole herbs thing ... but instead of helping the game, as they did with the originals (where all this contributed to a sense of tension), they make the game impossible to play. This is because RE5 is not a survival/horror game. It is half perfectly generic, bland action game - kind of a poor-man's Gears of War - with archaic and broken controls.

The game is spiritually and conceptually bankrupt. There are many head-nods to RE canon, with old characters reappearing and a creaky extension of the endlessly mutable T-Virus plot line, but in that respect it's a lot like one of those straight-to-video 'sequels' that drops a few established words and phrases for borrowed credibility and a free reserve of good will. Yet the game completely fails to build on those starting points and it just feels like a soulless cash-grab.

You don't get to know any of the locations because you're speeding through them on linear paths. There are no puzzles beyond the lock-and-key variety, and most keys come from vanquished foes. The enemies are simply ridiculous, not scary, and mostly bipedal: 'zombies' riding motorbikes and shooting AK-47s, big fat guys with chainguns. Gameplay devolves into standing still and spinning in a circle to shoot the braindead enemies or engaging in tedious cover-based bullet swapping. And for the first time in RE history that I've ever noticed, an RE game uses spawners. Not even in a subtle way either. You can see dogs appearing in the shipping crates and then running out to get you.

The bosses are uninspired and tedious - the multi-headed 'hydra' theme is played to the max. One battle has you pick up a gun specifically designed to kill that boss, which slowly recharges as you try to dodge the boss' strikes (which are Quick Time Events, ugh). The entire battle is you standing still, occasionally dodging, and firing the weapon ... nine ... flipping ... times. It doesn't ramp in difficulty, it doesn't change at all. You literally just do the same thing nine times in a row.

In general the weapons are boring, just lots of revisions of the same basic things (handgun, shotgun, rifle, etc). And if you thought the 'what are you buying' guy in RE4 was a really dumb way to handle weapons, RE5 doubles down on that stupidity by just putting the guns in big shiny briefcases all over the levels. Inventory management continues to slide downhill - I don't know why everyone hated the item boxes which were an effective solution, but now you can only access your items between 'chapters' in the game. Inventory management itself is still cumbersome and unwieldy and worst of all the game doesn't pause while you do it.

And finally there is the co-op. Let me just say that a long time ago I was a fan of co-op. It was one of those things that was rare in a game, so when someone did it they generally had a compelling reason and it was a fun but separate element. Then it became the big fad and everyone decided everything had to be co-op to the point that there are no single-player campaigns. Sure you can play 'single player' but that's just co-op with the computer, which is somehow even dumber than my friends. So now you're stuck shepherding a dumb Barney around the entire game, someone who consumes your bullets and ammunition and constantly does stupid things. Most importantly the mere presence of a second person, in addition to the ridiculous depiction of the main character (biceps like smoked hams) puts the final nail in the coffin of the supposed horror aspect of the game.

Am I the only one who remembers what RE was about? It was about a single person, with some tactical training but with human limitations, trapped in a series of small, learnable, but terrifying environments and using their wits (and the occasional bullet) to survive.

This isn't a Resident Evil game. More importantly, this isn't a good game. It's just a very polished, professional looking piece of generic junk using a licensed name. If it were a movie it would have been made by Michael Bay. It's a tremendous disappointment.","Not Resident Evil, but worse, not fun",1252713600,65,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

So I was taken advantage of by selling the older model for the newer model price and making me pay 109.98 extra for the upgrades.

1) There are little to almost no puzzles, which makes the game far too easy.
2) There are only 5 levels; each one takes about 15-20 minutes to complete. The game is TOO SHORT.
3) The controls are very out-of-whack; The flashlight seems to fly into every direction when you flick the Wii Remote. Sometimes it just sticks to the side of the TV screen!
4) You cannot run; only walk. The creaters of this game must have done this to try and make the game feel longer; but they failed miserably.
5) The interactive cut-scenes can be extremely frustrating, since half of the time the Wii Remote doesn't work when you try to use it.
6) No voice acting; just a bunch of loud and abnoxious gasps, pants, and screams.
7) The scares can be chilling in the first run through, but they never change. Everything is far too predictable and the game overall becomes boring.
8) The plot is terrible; a girl who's dog gets loose into a run-down factory when taken out on a walk, and when she gives chase inside, her family gets cursed.

I feel the need to add that while I was holding them in the store, my wife WARNED me and I should have listened. She said, ""didn't you have an afterglow controller and HATED it and never used it?"" And I said yes and proceeded to tell her that these headsets had a compair chart on the side of the box with them and turtlebeaches. But honestly, I thought they looked cool.
I got them home and was impressed by the box, as well as impressed by the headphones themselves. Then the sadness came. I have my Xbox hooked up with an hdmi cord so naturally I hooked them up the same way my tbs were hooked up. (Using the adapter I purchased) nothing. Friends texted me saying they could hear me, but I couldn't hear them.
So I tried to hook them up to the tv, I have a tv made past 2009 so naturally it doesn't have a audio out plugs. So my next option, (according to the booklet and a video on YouTube on how to hook it up) was to plug it into the headphone jack on my tv, which is on the back and the cord from the headset is so short on that end, I had to place my Xbox behind the tv.
It WORKED!!!! Yayyy, but wait, now, the game volume on the controller makes the chat volume go up and down as well as the actual game volume, and the chat volume only makes the game volume go down.

The packaging for $139 is mostly cheap plastic, not a cool box like I'm used to from Razer.  The mouse is neat.  Feels a little big but I imagine that's to do with all the buttons on the side.

Where you run into the problem is when you update and load the software.  Then you CANNOT save your setup.  The LED can be changed to any color you'd like, but every time you exit that program or reboot, its back to default.  What is the point of having a mouse with configurable buttons and no ability to save your setup?

You've got all those buttons but no matter how you program them they will just go back to default.

Many of the building models have generic signage - ""Low Cost Apartments,"" ""Mid Cost Business,"" I mean, come on, that was not intended.  Those models weren't ready to be released to the public.  But you can zoom down to street level and drive down the street of your city with the camera at about the height of a streetlight and just get a feel for what it must be like to live, walk, drive and work there, and it looks and feels like a real city, and that's just awesome.

Much has been made - by Maxis - of the fact that every single Sim is persistently simulated.  Who cares?  This part of the game is not interesting.  I clicked on about 50 Sims and vehicles and never saw anything that interested me.  Pathing and traffic are especially stupid; 100% of vehicles will ignore a highest-density road in favor of a dirt path if the highest-density road is 0.01% longer.  That's stupid.  Unfortunately, all the simulation that I bothered to investigate is that stupid.  And the obsession with ploppables and sewage is frankly disturbing; if the rest of the game had had the same level of obsessive detail as the sewage simulation, I think it'd actually be a six star game.  Sadly for the star count in this review, I don't care that much about sewage.

You can't run the game at all without pinging the servers repeatedly; you can't save a game, Origin (EA's stupid Steam clone) decides what gets saved and what you are permitted to resume; and you can't revert to prior if you do something dumb and wreck your city.  These are choices made by EA to force you to use Origin and to prevent pirates from playing.  They are stupid choices.

Also, did you know you were buying a game lease from Amazon, not a copy of a game?  It's in the first paragraph of the EULA; you agree that you are allowed to play your leased game until EA says you are not allowed to play it any more, or until you want to uninstall it.  Period.  I don't know about that; I'm not Richard Stallman but I think this is a little ridiculous.  If EA didn't make a big deal about it, maybe I wouldn't; but their servers are busted and they can't even make their stupid idea of a game lease WORK.  That's a big deal, it's a big deal EA made, and they now have to eat the fruits of their stupidity, which is the fact that they are getting panned across the entire globe for something that probably half the gamers in the world were ready to get totally excited about.

I expect EA to roll out updates that will fix some of the above; I doubt the superficial quality of the simulation will get fixed, and that's too bad.  I never played SC4, so I find that my experience with this version of SimCity has encouraged me to boot up Steam and buy a copy of it for $19.95.  I don't think that speaks very well for this game.","Busted servers, bad DRM, superficial simulation",1362787200,14,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

I'd give this minus 12 stars if I could because it is a misleading rip-off. The review won't let me adjust the two stars I gave it earlier.

I like Wii Sports Tennis quite a bit but wanted the added ability to move the player around the court. This also had some tennis ball whacking mini-games that looked like fun.

Sega Superstars Tennis is IMO, built more like a button mashing game. Take serving for example: there is no relationship between the ball toss (the ball you see) and your racket. Instead, like a power meter on a golf game, you watch a vertical row of stars and the ""serve"" hardest when it is at the apex. You time your ""swing"" to the meter, the ball is not hit WHEN you swing.

Here's a minor thing When you are standing there, you can't swing the racket. The racket is not really connected to your movements (I'm not a perfectionist, it works well enough in Wii Sports Tennis to make me happy).

And, when you do swing it is more like you are just giving the game a button combo. Sure you swing up or at the side and that is read, but when you watch the character, they seem to simply follow a preset ""instruction"" and it doesn't seem in synch with the movement of the Wii remote. I want to swing the racket and see the racket on screen move. I have plenty of experience with Wii Sports Tennis and again, I am NOT asking for perfection.

The character's racket swings not only look pre-set but they are hard to see; another reason why you feel disconnected.

Further, the mini-games. They ARE, as far as I can tell, button mashing games ONLY (use the buttons on the remote to play) You do not get to swing the remote or use the Nunchuck. No matter how I set the options* for the controller, the mini-games only allow the buttons and tell you to unplug the Nunchuck (if you have it plugged in).

This, in my opinion, is not a good Wii game. If you like the button mashing type games, you may have fun with it.

*There is an overall game setting for the type of remote you want to use: Normal (remote only, the onscreen characters move themselves), Remote + Nunchuck, and Remote using buttons only.

Please realize people that if you aren't logged in to Games for Windows (which means being connected to the internet), you CANNOT SAVE.  You just wanted to skip the Windows Live stuff in the beginning so you can get right into the ""awesome"" game you just bought, right?  Well, too bad.  All that progress is lost.

I was constantly having to change the brightness level to keep up with it, outside is way to bright and inside is way to dark with no auto brightness changes (kinda like if she had to think about changing the dialation of her eyes).

The main problem was that I had to keep the volume down pretty low, or the other people in my game could hear themselves echo. The microphone is actually right up near the earpiece and the part that sticks out is just a hollow tube that delivers the sound. Because of this the microphone can pick up the earpiece audio.

As shown in the customer image I uploaded, the LED count is lower. There are 3 IR LEDs per side instead of 5, the placements are different, and brightness is wildly inconsistent from one LED to the next.  The cursor becomes jumpy and the remote has an extremely hard time reading the LEDs when the bar is used from any sort of angle at all, even while the official Nintendo bar is still read perfectly fine from the same spot.  Unless the bar is positioned straight in front of the player at the same level as the remote, the remote will not be able to generate a stable and useable cursor.  This means that it pretty much has to be used below the TV, and, as a further sign of how low quality this bar really is, the holes on the bottom don't even align correctly with Nintendo's sensor bar stand.

The sensor bar is not a complicated device- just a few LEDs and a power cord- and even a well constructed bar should not be expensive.  The exorbitant price charged for this item in no way reflects its quality but simply the luxury of having a USB plug.  I was still willing to pay for the convenience of getting a USB connection, but in retrospect I'd rather have taken the chance trying to mod an official sensor bar myself.  The Nextronics bar still works if it's placed below the TV set rather than above it, and yes, it does have a USB plug and never requires batteries, but it's also a cheap knock-off that costs several times more than the name brand while performing dramatically worse.  Take it or leave it; as inefficient as turning a whole system on to power a sensor bar was, I had a much better time using the official sensor bar plugged into my old Wii system than using this bar.",Poor value and mediocre quality,1357948800,31,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Uqw8UsCPL._SY88.jpg']

2.0,False,"02 28, 2015",ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B00BGA9Y3W,Poisoned Blade,"I was excited about Destiny because it won a hojillion awards at GDC when it was announced.  It was going to be Halo meets an MMO and the greatest thing ever!  I was excited when I first started playing.  There was an intro movie about the Traveler, which introduced quantum leaps in technology and humanity thrived and spread across the galaxy.  Unfortunately, there was a force called the Darkness that attempts to destroy the Traveler and beat back humanity until a single city on Earth remained.  On the verge of intergalactic extinction, humanity launched a desperate counterattack.

My character was resurrected by a small drone called a ghost.  Which is kind of ironic since I was the one brought back from the dead.  Anyway, I was excited because the ghost was voiced by Peter Dinklage, Tyrion from Game of Thrones.  I like that show and I was pretty happy.  After being Awakened, I battled through a dungeon and was treated to some pretty solid Halo-esque gameplay with great graphics and a good musical score.  The guns felt great and the AI was challenging, but not cheap.  Tyrion... I mean the Ghost brought me to the City and I was able to get some weapons and armor.  I picked a Hunter Class because they're fast and agile.  My handler was voiced by Nathan Fillion, Captain Mal from Firefly!  I like that show and I was pretty happy.

So now the ghost gave me a mission so I went back and battled more enemies.  But something struck me as odd.  I realized I was on the exact same map and I fought the exact same enemies.  To make matters worse, my quest made me backtrack through the map repeatedly.  The maps are fairly large and there are some nice combat zones where enemies spawn and there's some well placed level geometry that is perfect for good shootouts.  About 20 minutes later, I had a severe case of deja vu.  I was fighting the same enemies by the same truck eight times in a row!!!  When I finished the mission, I went back to the city and got new gear.  But I was not excited about the gear.

I replaced my Combat Boots Armor Class 7 with Combat Boots Armor Class 8.  I got a gun that did 23 damage instead of 21 damage.  And that was it.  So, I went on another quest.
It was the exact same map!!!  Only this time, the enemies had small 2's by their heads indicating that they were level 2 enemies.  And that's basically your first 10 hours of gameplay.  You fight enemies, you get slightly better gear, you go back to the same few levels, fight the same enemies in the exact same spots, and each time they have a higher number near their heads.  You do unlock a few skills like knife throw and grenade.  Both are unlimited and have cool down periods.  But that's the extent of the first 10 hours of gameplay.  If you die during a boss fight, you cannot respawn.  You have to start the boss battle over again, so this also adds to the repetition.

Then you start to notice Tyrion's voice acting.  It's the worst voice acting on the PS4... and probably the PS3.  It's as bad as the original Resident Evil.  It's cringe-worthy.  The problem is that Tyrion... I mean ghost is trying to sound robotic (wooden) but he is also sarcastic.  So, when you are playing a game that has obvious issues, it sounds like your only companion is constantly mocking the game.

To make things worse, every boss fight features a massive character who walks around and shoots at you.  That's it.  Every boss fights EXACTLY the same way.  And sometimes they spawn familiar enemies into the arena to mix it up.  Around the 7th Boss fight, Ghost activates an ancient relic and says, ""I have no idea what is going to happen now.""  I said, ""I do.  A giant boss is going to appear, walk in circles and fire energy blobs at me while random enemies spawn into the arena.""  So Ghost activated the relic and guess what???
A giant boss appeared, walked in circles, fired energy blobs at me while random enemies spawned into the arena.
What a shock.

Now, after you pass level 10, and if you are still interested in playing this game, things do get better.  A new class of enemies are introduced and your weapons level up to unlock perks.  For example, your shotgun may have a full auto feature where you hold the button down and it fires 4 massive rounds into enemies.  At point black range, you can kill any of the sub bosses.  It's a nice feature.  The second half of the game plays much better than the first half and starts to get fun.

If you have Playstation Plus, you can go on Strike Missions (3 players play coop and battle through a dungeon.)  Yeah, it's the same enemies and boss, but working as a team, it really is fun.

Then once you get the hang of the game, it ends.  At level 18, you fight a mission, battle a giant boss with random enemies spawning around him like every other boss and all of a sudden you win.  It feels really anti-climactic.  Also, in order to remain as repetitive as possible, they do spawn 3 identical bosses one after the other at the end.  So, you basically fight the same guy 3 times.  After you win, you go back to the tower and there are other players dancing.  (You only get 4 emotes: dance, point, lie down, and wave.)  Now, you can go quest and get better weapons and fight the same enemies over and over and over again with your friends.  At this point, you are so tired of fighting the same guys, you don't even want to play.

Destiny features multiplayer modes where you can team up and kill other players, but there are lots of level 30 guys who destroy you before you can even get a few shots off.  If you're good and at a high level, this is fun.  But when you first start, it's not.

To make matters worse, the story isn't really explained.  Who are these races that you can play?  Who are these bad guys?  Where did they originate?  Why are there no characters in the game besides the Ghost and the guys who sell me stuff at the Tower and say the same crappy 10 things?  This feels like Halo without the Master Chief.  Also, all of the alien robot enemies have Dungeons and Dragons names like Goblin, Minotaur, Hobgoblin, Cyclops...  I guess the Creative Director played D&D.

So, basically Destiny is this:
Log into a battle arena, fight enemies, get better gear, log into a tougher battle arena, fight slightly tougher enemies, get slightly better gear, repeat.
If you have Playstation Plus, you can play cooperatively or PVP.  If you don't, you can still fight alongside other adventurers if you see them in a map.  But you can't formally join up and go on strike missions.
As soon as I finished the last mission, I was done.  I was already bored of killing the same enemies in the same areas over and over again.  Why do I want to do this after level 20?!

The story is horrible.  The acting is horrible.  The cutscenes are cheesy, few, and far between.  The RPG elements are non-existent because you're just a resurrected alien with guns and there is no backstory at all.  The weapon upgrade system is very bland.  The levels sell themselves short because they are very large, but you only fight in a few concentrated places over and over again.  At times you can summon a speeder bike and race to another area, but you're just zipping through canyons for a minute.  Since there is no action here, it also feels boring.
If the combat wasn't fun, this game would be the perfect turd.  All of the guns handle well and the enemies are fun to fight.  The AI tries to flank you and they will charge.  The enemies are challenging without feeling cheap or predictable.  The damage they do is fair and if you do get killed, you usually know why.

So, if you like Halo-esque combat and can overlook the grinding feeling of battling the same bad guys in the same place over and over and over again, you will probably like this game.  If the repetition and awful voice acting will drive you nuts, then steer clear of this game.",Destiny: A Gamer's Diary and A Tale of Sadness,1425081600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

However, it seems to me that the game's development was somewhat rushed. The most glaring example of this is that the stylus controls are not well done. I think it's fun and fresh to control Kirby in a creative way by drawing lines with a stylus on the tablet, but in my opinion Nintendo has done a poor implementation of these controls. It seems to me that Kirby often does not get onto a line drawn, even if it is started on top of him, or directly below him (where I'd imagine his paws are). Also, I noticed that lines often erase so quickly by the game that it seems to compromise the gameplay, and multiple interconnecting lines have to be used - all while hoping that the dubious controls code will work correctly at the intersection(s), which is often not the case. I would expect that Kirby would run towards the beginning of a rainbow line (at least as long as it was accessible from where he is), which he generally does not do in my experience. I think it has the potential to be a great game, but needs a well-coded controls software patch to realize more of its potential.

I had anticipated this game since ex-Irrational/2K Marin developers, known for the Bioshock games and the underrated The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, worked on this. What could possibly go wrong, right? Apparently a lot. Read on to find out why I'm so down on this game.

So, let's start with the game's most praised aspect, shall we? The story has been the most praised portion of this game, however it's honestly not that great. Just lots of racial slurs to describe blacks and whites. While I expected something more complex to better represent the time and the issues in the US, I instead got the most simplistic black & white narrative that one could tell. And instead of doing it justice with the complexity it deserves, it turned out to be pretty much just a revenge tale where you're just killing a bunch of people, almost to the point that it makes me feel dirty. Yes, it's a game, however something that deals with serious topics such as this should be handled differently. That said, the voice acting is top notch overall. The soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in a game. So when it comes to audio, Mafia III delivers.

As far as the gameplay is concerned, the shooting is good. It's fun and packs a punch, but the gameplay loop gets way too repetitive for its own good. Story missions with unique environments are few and far between. Most of the time you're doing the most repetitive, mundane side content to open up more missions, and those missions somehow feel just as repetitive and mundane as the side content. Maybe 10% of the missions in this game feel like they've actually had thought and care put into them. The rest of the missions feel like the most throwaway side content from an Ubisoft game like Assassin's Creed or Far Cry. This game simply lacks content. I mean, you could play it for 30 hours, but it's 30 hours of shallow activities that aren't meaty or satisfying.

The worst part of this game, though, is how rough it is. Graphical glitches galore having to do with lighting, textures, etc. This is one of the buggiest games out there. In addition to that, there's some severe screen-tear. Perhaps this would be acceptable to a degree if this was an ambitious game, but it's not. You have the most shallow mission structure, mediocre graphics most of the time, etc. There is no excuse for this level of laziness when it comes to polish.

So what's good? The shooting, the soundtrack, and the voice acting.
Why don't those things elevate it beyond 2 stars? Because of the bad things such as the mission structure, the slipshod storytelling, the glitches, etc. It feels like a game that needed AT LEAST another year in development.

Avoid Mafia III and buy Mafia and Mafia II instead. While the first two games aren't perfect, they're a hell of a lot better than this rushed game.",Where do I even start?,1480896000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

SOUND: Aircraft engine and weapon sound effects were great, as were the sound of targets being destroyed. You see the explosion, THEN you hear it. Very nice... Now, the game sound is another point that I don't like. The radio chatter, although nice at first, gets VERY annoying, VERY fast. You hear ground forces arguing about who is better, and your fellow pilots also complain about some of the most inane stuff imaginable, all during the heat of battle. However, the catch is that the radio chatter sometimes provides key mission updates. Radio or no radio? That is the question...

CONTROL: Nice and tight, just like Ace Combat 4. Although now, you use the D-pad to issue wingman orders. Nothing much new to report as far as controls are concerned.

Well you cannot change his music and and enterance to make him the loveble Eddie that we all remember.

Mickie James(Phsyco) Spirt Squad, andothers. Also Lita doesnt Come Out with Edge. Many other things wrong with this game. The Biggest Problem I had with Smackdown Vs. Raw 06 is that when you are in a match the Ref gets in the way all the time, so when you are hitting your opponent, the ref will stand there and if you hit him on accident he will DQ you... Cost me a title too many times. It also gets kind of annoying when you play Batista on the Smackdown ring and Micheal Cole and Tazz will argue about Batista Not being on Smackdown!!!! HELLO!!!! HE IS!!!!! The legends are kinda cool, but i wish they had more. I noticed alot of people wanted Lesner as a legend, and I agree!!! Next to Batista, Rey, Eddie, he was my favorite superstar, and i guess i will have to go and buy HCTP again to use him and F-5 my opponents. I heard that they are doing Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007, and i would love to see D-X on there. Also the season was way to short and they only had one storyboard for each show.

You can choose from ""classes"" that have 10-15 minute workouts focusing on upper body, core body, general fitness, cardio, boot camp, kick boxing, cardio dance, pilates, latin dance, and dance moves. The workouts are all very good, professionally designed exercises that teach you good technique and posture. As others have written, your on-screen trainer is cartoony to say the least, but that's to be expected with the Wii.

One thing I wasn't too crazy about was how quickly the on-screen trainers move, without breaking down their moves or otherwise giving you a chance to learn them. This is especially frustrating on some of the quick ""dance step"" routines. But with enough repetition, you'll eventually get them.

The lack of motion controls was a deal buster for me. Granted, many people enjoy workout titles without the motion controls, but to me, if I'm going to work out like that I'd rather just pop in a DVD and watch a real human instead of watching a cartoony character I can't interact with. At the very least I would have liked to see them build-in the option for motion detection, with the ability to shut them off. But it seems that after debacles like Your Shape with Jenny McCarthy, Ubisoft seems to have thrown in the towel completely in terms of trying to get motion detection correct. Worse, the fact that this game supports a USB camera may lead some to believe that it has Kinect-like motion controls; of course, it doesn't--all connecting the camera does is show a postage stamp-sized video image of you in the corner, not even aligned with the on-screen trainer so you can't compare your steps to his or hers.

Overall, I'd say if you liked the original My Fitness Coach, you'll probably like this. It's a worthy successor to it in that it provides a much wider selection of exercises and doesn't let poor motion controls (or any motion controls) get in the way of your workout. A few years ago, I might have given this 5 stars, but in 2011, it's just ""ok"", especially when compared to other similar games on the Xbox and Playstation, or even other games like EA Sports Active on the Wii which do advanced things like good motion detection and heart rate monitoring.","What ""My Fitness Coach 2"" should have been, perhaps a few years late.",1309564800,23,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'}",

2.0,False,"06 3, 2012",A1TQW58W1OT68B,B00178631E,AM,"When Remedy originally sold the Max Payne franchise to Rockstar, I was worried.  The GTA franchise is a huge seller; let no one accuse Rockstar of not knowing how to make a popular game, but Max Payne had always been an extremely distinct, special experience, the kind of thing generally best left with the creators, I feared.  The game is finally out, and my fears have been realized.  There's no question Rockstar made a real effort; Max Payne 3 is absolutely not a quick cash in--but it's also not Max Payne.

Gameplay:  Max Payne 3's gameplay brings bullet time along from the older titles.  It basically has to; Remedy invented the mechanic way back in Max Payne.  It defines the series almost as much as the noir atmosphere.  It still works, but I find that it's less useful defensively than it was in previous iterations.  In Max Payne 2, I could turn on bullet time and clear a room, coming up smelling like roses.  In MP3, I'm as likely as not to come up smelling like the blood leaking from multiple holes in Max's body.  Whether this is because I die more quickly, or because I kill more slowly (enemies seem to survive body shots more readily in Max Payne 3 than before), I don't know, but the end result is that I almost always have to save my bullet time for shootdodging.  It's not a gamebreaker, but it detracts from the experience.

The difficulty on the whole is drastically higher than previous Max Payne games, something I've seen noted in more professional reviews.  Getting shot HURTS.  As it should, certainly, but the damage accrues far faster than in the past, and painkillers are MUCH less common.  A medicine chest on easy in Max Payne 2 could have 4 painkillers.  I've never seen more than two next to each other in Max Payne 3, and never had more than three at a time available.  In Max Payne 2, sometimes I actually got up to the cap, 8 bottles.  Between taking damage faster, and having fewer opportunities for restoring health, the game becomes substantially more difficult than its predecessors.  ""Easy"" isn't.

The direct result of this is that the player is often stuck watching the same cutscene multiple times, and putting up with death after death after death. (Who in the hell thought unskippable cutscenes were a good idea?  You can't even quit the game while one plays!).  I won't pretend to be a stellar player, but I don't usually have this kind of trouble in anything.  Rockstar's apparent solution to the game being awfully hard is to respawn you with full health, and if you keep dying, throw you a painkiller or two to ease you through.  This does help, but to get these nudges, you have to put up with quite a lot of dying.

Cover has been added to Max Payne 3, in the Gears of War sense.  Press a button, get into cover.  Aim, shoot, kill from cover.  This is the first situation in which I feel Rockstar misunderstood what a Max Payne game is.  You could call this modernization, but for me, the Max Payne games were fun specifically because I could run, dive, shoot, slow time, and generally kill everything in sight, without hiding behind a wall and picking off enemies from relative safety.  Cover is realistic, but the Max Payne series was never ABOUT realism; it was a heavily stylized cross between film noir and John Woo.

The last gameplay gripe I have is simply that your weapon carrying in Max Payne is extremely limited.  You can carry one or two pistol sized weapons, and one large weapon.  Dual wielding pistols means you drop the larger gun, as it had been carried in your off hand.  Again, realism where it's not needed.  Having a small arsenal at your disposal in the previous games of the series is a dated style, but it's fun.

Graphics:  I honestly have not got a single complaint about the game's graphics.  Max Payne 3 is stunningly gorgeous; Rockstar's artists, animators, and engine programmers absolutely hit the ball out of the park.  It's possible to grind the game to a very low framerate, even on a high end machine, if you turn on both MSAA and FXAA, but both aren't really necessary.  Dropping one or the other can help a lot.  Light works like it should, people look like they should and move believably, skin is well modeled.  If there's anything about which one could complain it's that during cutscenes, the game can approach the ""uncanny valley,"" where something looks so realistic it's offputting, because it's slightly inhuman.

Atmosphere and presentation:  This is where Max Payne 3 really falls flat.  Max Payne has always been characterized by really heavy ""film noir"" elements.  These are completely absent from Max Payne 3.  You do get Max's occasional self-pity, and drug/alcohol problem, but as portrayed here, they feel more like something on a modern crime drama than something out of an old detective story somehow set in the modern day.  Previous games carried the deliberately cheesy, over-the-top element of film noir perfectly.  Max Payne 3 makes the occasional allusion to it, but it's just not there.  You get a tiny, tiny glimpse of it in a flashback about 1/3 through the game, but it doesn't last.

I think the problem here is two fold: First, the setting change is ill-suited to noir.  Sunny Sao Paulo, Brazil is full of flashy nightclubs, bikini clad women (boobs in a Rockstar game?  WHO'DA THUNK IT?), and a culture so far removed from traditional noir that it just doesn't work.  Boobs for the sake of titillation and change for the sake of change just don't really work very well.  That the game is PACKED with untranslated Portuguese doesn't help either.  I'm all in favor of native language use, but there's so very much dialogue that's lost on most players that opportunities for good writing are missed by players who can't understand the language.  Subtitles are just captions in Portuguese.

Second, Rockstar's writers just weren't up to the task.  Max Payne and Max Payne 2 were deliberately kitschy, as noir generally is, but Max Payne 3 tends to fall back on crude rather than clever.  During the opening cutscene, the player hears a line similar to, ""I wouldn't know good from bad if good were feeding the poor and bad was bangin' my sister.""  Remedy didn't feel the need to resort to bawdiness to make the over-the-top metaphors common to the noir style.  There's a time and a place for everything, but when continuing one of the best, if not the best, third person shooting franchises in history, a little more respect for origins is called for.  If you can't maintain the style, hire someone who can.

Presentation is a real sticking point.  Max Payne 1 and 2 did have cutscenes here and there, but much of the game's narrative was carried out in highly atmospheric visual novel pages on screen, with appropriate narration.  It's hard to overstate just what staying in this heavily atmospheric style added to the game.  If nothing else, they provided the series with a strong sense of identity.  That identity was lost with Max Payne 3's presentation.  Cutscenes are how ALL plot exposition is handled, and those cutscenes are absolutely packed with some of the most obnoxious camera filters I've ever seen.  For no apparent reason, in a scene where Max is completely sober (and even if he weren't, the scene is third person and not from his perspective anyway), colors are randomly separated into red/blue/yellow, looking almost like a shoddy kids' 3D glasses effect.  In other places, color is strongly desaturated, or the view is de-interlaced (think scanlines, like a really old arcade game).  Words that Rockstar felt were important get plastered on the screen for an instant, but this provides no real impact--like the other effects, it's jarring, and detracts from cutscenes, rather than creating atmosphere.

Overall:  The package, taken as a whole, is a relatively playable game, with real bright spots here and there.  Unfortunately, those bright spots serve more to show the player what could've been than to truly improve the game.  Rockstar took one of PC gaming's most respected modern franchises, and I honestly believe they tried their best with it.  Unfortunately, their best seems to have required a ""go with what you know"" approach that makes Max Payne 3 feel more like a linear, third person shooter Brazilian GTA side story than a true Max Payne sequel.  Max Payne purists, those who loved the game for the narrative and portrayal, and Max Payne as a character, should probably keep your distance.","More frustrating, less fun than its predecessors",1338681600,157,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The graphics are nice with little difference between game play and cut scenes and the storyline seems really involved. However, the problem I had was with the game's camera.

I know this is a problem with most 3-D/free roaming games and it's no exception here. The camera wants to constantly shift to give you a better view of the character you're playing, which is great if you're watching a movie, but not so good if you're playing a game. And yes, you can control the camera by pressing the R2 and L2 buttons at the same time, which repositions the camera behind the character, but as soon as you move, the camera swings again, giving you a different perspective.

With all the swinging involved, I got motion sickness after about an hour of game play. I know that game designers want to wow us with all of the camera angles etc., and how they can blur the lines between watching a movie and playing a game, but watching the character you're controlling run towards the camera, when you really need to see where you're going, is not helpful.

Another thing I don't like is that the camera is really closeup and you can't really see the environment clearly unless you switch to the first person/character view, which allows you to see through the character's eyes, but that slows down game play.

The gameplay, however, can be unresponsive.

Like all other Game Boy Mortal Kombats, this game would be short. You only get to fight 9 characters in Master mode, 7 in Warrior, and 5 in Novice.

The best attack to use is just kicking. That's kinda sad. Usually, the uppercut would be the best standard attack to use, but no. Instead, it's KICKING.

The enemy AI is way too easy to beat. I got through Master mode without any trouble. Granted, they can attack almost decently, but just throw 5 kicks and then it's possible he/she'd die. It can be glitchy when it comes to fighting Scorpion and Shinnok. You can still attack them even while they use their ""Get over here"" attacks on you.

Traveling on horseback covers more ground and you can survive tremendous falls if you are mounted, but since this game is all about farming you'll miss a lot of crafting items.

On foot, your character must jump to clear tiny obstacles like tree roots. That's not good when you're in combat and the 3rd person camera is buried in a nearby bush. You have no idea why you can't evade the enemy. You just die and hope you come back where you can actually see yourself.

I played the Mass Effect series repeatedly so I love BioWare. And I didn't mind the first Dragon's Age and I like RPGs. But this one is absolutely painful to play.

For those that adore getting immersed in an epic science-fantasy novel, you may tolerate the excruciatingly slow pace. But if you want a game where you feel like you're actually making progress then you should look elsewhere. I suspect that all the favorable reviews were from Dragon Age veterans who knew what to expect.

That's cool that so many people loved this game. And I expect many down votes just because they don't agree with my assessment. I'm just trying to provide a perspective from someone who wasn't already steadfastly loyal to this series.","Too much walking, talking, and crafting required",1430784000,16,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

2.0,True,"12 26, 2013",A3VONQL7YW8UPM,B00CMQTVUA,LUCK,"We pre-ordered the Day One Xbox One from Microsoft.  I'm glad to say that we have not experienced the disk loading/playing issues that so many others are reporting.  As a frame of reference: I'm a regular user of Microsoft devices (Windows Phone, Surface tablet, Xbox 360 and now Xbox One) - so in general I like what Microsoft has to offer.  I'm also a reasonably technical guy and don't generally have much problem figuring out technology.

With all of that said, I can only recommend the Xbox One for a small group of individuals at this time.

One other item to note: This is not intended to compare the Xbox One to the PS4.  My guess is that the Xbox One would have roughly the same pros/cons as the PS4.  This is mostly written for those who already have a game console (particularly an Xbox 360 - but really any other console that they're happy with) and are wondering if the time is right to purchase an Xbox One.

BOTTOM LINE:

* If you are an avid gamer, and one or more of the very small collection of games available on the Xbox One today is something that you enjoy - then I'd recommend going ahead and purchasing this.  My understanding is that this may be particularly true for individuals who enjoy online multiplayer games.

* For anyone else, you'll probably be happier sticking with your existing game console for another 6-12 months before making the leap.

* If you're not a gamer, and you already have Apple products (PC, iPhone, iPad) then I think you would be far happier with an AppleTV than an Xbox One at this time.

WHY DO I SAY THAT?  Glad you asked...

GAMES IN GENERAL: For me, the console is still mostly about the games.  And the Xbox One  has very few of them available.  Your old Xbox 360 games won't upgrade (I'm not complaining that the old games won't upgrade, and understand why) and with only 6-12 games of any quality out there for Xbox One, the selection is frustratingly limited right now.  In my opinion there are about a half-dozen really good games that take advantage of what the Xbox One offers.  But these only cover a few very specific categories.  If you're not into shooters, race car or sports games, or if you want more than 1 or 2 options in each of these categories - then you're going to be frustrated.

FAMILY/KINECT GAMES: Me?  I like strategic games (i.e. Civilization), open world games (i.e. Skyrim), block games (i.e. Minecraft), platformers (i.e. Crash Bandicoot was one that I'd liked) and, yes, the occasional shooter (i.e. Call of Duty, Halo).  As a family, we really like some of the family-oriented Kinect games (i.e. the Kinect-based sports titles).  Of all of the aforementioned categories, there is really only one game (in my opinion) of any quality on the Xbox One that fits one of those descriptions (Call of Duty: Ghosts).  And there is not a single Kinect game available yet that approaches the quality of the Kinect games available for the Xbox 360.

OTHER APPS: Aside from the games, the Xbox One does offer some other compelling features - one of which is the ability to add apps to it (much as you can to a phone, iPad or Windows 8 PC).

* We've actually found the Skype app to be a really nice app to have on our Xbox.  On Christmas day, we all sat in front of the TV and Skyped the rest of our family in India, California, DC and Tulsa.  If you Skype a lot and you'd like to do it with a large group sitting in front of your TV, then you may find this a compelling reason to buy.

* There are a variety of other video playing apps for the device.  As an Amazon Prime member, I really like the fact that I can get to my Amazon Prime videos (no more hooking my Kindle up to my TV to watch these shows).  We're also Netflix members and can get to the Netflix videos as well.  Microsoft has their own video store that has a pretty good selection too.  We're not members of others, but there are options for Hulu, Verizon Fios and maybe some other video apps.

* Snapping the NFL app up next to a football game was cool for about 15 minutes.  But it doesn't really provide any good info and was too complex for anyone in the family except for me.

* None of these other apps, however, would be reason enough for me to recommend an Xbox One (assuming you have another device that already gives you access to these items - as we do).  It's convenient to have them all in one place, but not a compelling enough reason to buy this unit yet.

BUGS / PERFOMANCE: There are still a lot of things about my Xbox that don't seem quite ready for prime time...

* Other than games, one of the main reasons I was excited to get our Xbox One was the promise of all of our Microsoft devices working together to easily share music, video and photos.  While there has been an improvement, it is still not nearly where our AppleTV was about 5 years ago.  You can't (from what I can tell), select music, pictures or videos on your other device and ""send them"" to the Xbox One.

* Sharing your collection across devices is possible, but it is ""hobbled"".  For example, I have an Xbox music account.  When I'm logged into the Xbox using my Microsoft account, I can select all of the music that I want.  It's very nice because I can even hand-pick music that I want to play from Microsoft's library - and I don't have to pay for it (other than the monthly fee for my Xbox Music account).  However, if anyone else in my family is logged into the Xbox One as themselves, they don't have access to my music library.  They can manually login as me - but then, if I'm listening to my music on another device, it will only allow it to stream to one of the two devices at a time.  Because we could all easily just stream music, pics and video straight from our other Apple devices to our AppleTV (without having to go through a sync process and/or have a paid monthly account), we never experienced this problem with the AppleTV.

- Existing music playlists don't sync quickly across devices as one would expect.  When I first create a playlist, it seems to propagate across all my devices fairly quickly.  But when I make a change to a list on one device (i.e. my Surface tablet), I waited days for it to show up on my Xbox One before finally giving up and just creating a new playlist that then synced right away.  I didn't see options for manually telling the Xbox One to sync an existing playlist.

- Voice recognition leaves a LOT to be desired.  Maybe that's because I need to give it more time to ""train"" to recognize my voice.  Or maybe it requires our house to be quiet (our house is rarely quiet, with dishwashers, washing/drying machines and plenty of conversation all within earshot of the Xbox).  Many times I have to repeat the same command 2 or 3 times.  I've pretty much given up on bothering to use the voice recognition.

- The same seems to largely be the same for hand gestures.  This is improved over the Xbox 360 but, in most cases, I find it easier to just use the control.

- The TV app promises to eliminate the need for other remote controls.  You can plug your TV receiver (i.e. Cable TV, Satellite, etc) directly into the Xbox and train it to know what is plugged in.  There is a very cool ""One Guide"" that shows you available programming and let's you find what you want to watch - and it remembers favorites for you.  On the other hand, the OneGuide doesn't seems any easier to navigate than our regular SatTV guide, and you cannot yet give it voice commands like ""Show Me What Football Games are Playing"" or ""Watch Carolina Panthers"" - instead, it has to be something specific like ""Watch ESPN 2"" (so I am stuck navigating through all the channels to find the programming I want still).  The biggest problem, however, is that the TV app is buggy.  More than once I've tried to start it, and it has failed. Since our SatTV is now routed through our Xbox, we can't watch TV at all in these situations!  I've finally thrown up my hands and disconnected the SatTV from the Xbox and plugged it directly into our TV.  So the TV app is now useless.

- The Xbox allows you to program it to power on/off all your related devices when the Xbox.  I did this when I first set it up.  It worked fairly well, but sometimes it would not work with one or more of the devices (a relatively small annoyance).  I moved the Kinect to the top of the TV and now it doesn't work on any of the other devices at all.  The best I can tell, it issues remote control orders from the Kinect and, with that device now on top of the TV, it may not have line of sight ability to access those other devices.  When we initially relocated the Kinect, we went to the Xbox settings menu and re-synced the Kinect to the room - but that had no impact on the remote controls.  So we're back to using all of our remote controls as we normally did.

- Other apps seem to occasionally time out. For example, I was in the Xbox Store app and tried to open one of the games to see the description, and it locked up - I tried again and it did the same thing (but when attempting to open other game descriptions it worked fine).  As another example, I played a DVD one night; the next night we powered the Xbox on, took the first DVD out and inserted another - and it continued showing us a still shot of the first DVD until we completely powered down and restarted the device.

- Microsoft has an app called Xbox One Smart Glass that enriches the Xbox experience on your Windows 8 PC/tablet or on  your Windows Phone.  This sometimes works, but I've experienced a number of ""can't access our Xbox right now"" messages on it.

SUMMING IT ALL UP:

The Xbox One is much too buggy (and/or difficult to use) right now to make some of the exciting new features worthwhile, and the lack of games also makes it a less compelling option as an entertainment device.  The good news is that Microsoft will (hopefully) send out software patches that address most of the worst bugs and new games will be released.  Based on the game release schedule, it looks to me like it will be at least 6 months - and perhaps 12 months - before there is a diverse range of quality games available for this device.  If Microsoft chooses to ""port"" about 12 of the better Xbox 360 games over quickly, then it would make this device much more compelling sooner.

I'll plan to update this review and my rating in the coming months.  Feel free to leave a comment here if you're thinking of purchasing and want an updated perspective from me.","Not Worth Upgrading Your Xbox 360 (Yet): Buggy, Not Many Games Yet, Virtually No Kinect/Family Games",1388016000,13,,

2.0,False,"11 8, 2012",A32NXKGY4Z9O4C,B006NYWLTU,M. Kaplan,"I bought Super Monkey Ball for Vita mostly out of a misplaced sense of nostalgia.  I was a huge fan of the original Gamecube game, spending all hours of the night with college friends playing Monkey Target and other great minigames.  And 11 years later, I was ready to recapture that fun.

Unfortunately, that's all SMBBS really is: fan service and little more.  All the components are still there: solid level design in the main challenges, minigames, and so on.  But what's there is not really well implemented on the Vita.  Optional tilt controls are best avoided, as the Vita's gyroscope is simply not up to the task of handling the precision required by the main levels.  Sadly, the left analog stick doesn't fair much better, as the rather loose Vita analog doesn't allow for much of a range between barely moving and full throttle.  You'll find yourself rocking the analog back and forth uncomfortably in jarring motions, constantly fighting the game's singularly awful camera.

Unfortunately, much of the gameplay just hasn't held up well.  The main stages quickly ramp up in difficulty and are well designed, but everything else feels rote and by-the-numbers.  Even the supposed track creation function only allows you to generate a semi-random track using found/photographed objects.  The minigames are largely the same as those you've seen before, and the once highly-addictive Monkey Target and Monkey Bowling are relegated to easy, poor-controlling shadows of their former selves.  If you're a fan, you've seen this all before, and probably in a better-controlling form.

The graphics are decent but not exceptional.  Colors pop on the Vita's screen but textures are poor (the water in the Monkey Target stage looks like something from the N64 era).  Sound is pretty much what you'd expect.

All of this would be acceptable enough, except you're essentially getting a redux of an 11 year-old game for $30. Yes, it's cheaper than the average Vita game, but it would still be better placed as a $10 downloadable.  As is, I can't recommend buying Super Monkey Ball at this price unless you're a diehard fan who salivates at the thought of wrestling a poor camera and spotty controls in order to perform speed runs on tough (and admittedly decent) designed courses.

Sadly though, Dawn of Mana is a very disappointing platformer/RPG hybrid that doesn't do much of anything right in any department.

The game is more an action/platformer than an RPG, as you fling monsters around and into each other.  While this is entertaining for a while, it becomes boring quickly, and the sloppy and sluggish controls don't help matters much when it comes to targeting.  The sloppy controls also supremely hurt the platforming elements peppered throughout Dawn of Mana, and the game's schizoid camera doesn't help matters much either in this department.

The CAMPAIGN is INCREDIBLY boring until you get past the 6th block.  7-12 are better, but still lacking.  The side missions are incredibly lame.  The assassination missions take 0 skill.  Run to this place and kill this one guy that is just walking. The contracts don't even run away from you, have guards, or fight back.  Collecting the almanacs, encyclopedia pages and peg leg trinkets are super monotonous. And Connor, the main character is incredibly boring.  He has no charisma, and makes it impossible to get into the game and connect with him.  I collected all the feathers, easier than getting all the Borgia flags (AC veterans know what I'm talking about).  The only real notable additions to the game is the hunting, rope darts, and ship missions.  The ship missions are cool in that they remind me a bit of the Da Vinci missions, which were fun.  The DLC is better than the original game, which is really sad when you think about it.  If you could buy the 3 DLC separately, I would recommend that.

The ONLINE Multiplayer is where the game really falls apart.  The match making is terrible. If you are in a group, you are constantly getting separated.  If you're in a game with open spots, and you invite a friend, it will put them on the other team when they join, EVEN THOUGH YOU INVITED THEM AS PART OF YOUR TEAM!! You constantly get kicked into ""Offline Mode"", but don't get disconnected from the PlayStation Network, which is VERY annoying. The online has also been plagued with SLOPPY UBISOFT CODE.  There are hack and teleport glitches, which make many of the online modes unplayable.  Not hackers, glitches from sloppy coding.  If you want to do a private clan battle 4v4, you have to get your group of 4, then invite the other four 1 by 1, which throws you in a game and separates your team before you get started, so everyone ends up wasting 10 minutes before you can even start your clan battle.  10 minutes x 8 people is 80 wasted minutes!  Completely unacceptable.  The online items take longer to obtain, even with 19 prestiges I haven't unlocked everything, which is a nice change from the previous games.  The Champion packs are cool, but perhaps over priced. The real addition to the online mode if Wolf Pack, which your team of 4 chases down computer targets to get ""sync kills"" (which noobs don't understand).  The mode is really considered a place to waste your time which you're waiting for friends to finish a game, and to boost your challenge completion against the computer.  More of a chore than a fun game mode, but a nice try at something new.

As a result of these problems, most of the online community has gotten so frustrated they have moved on to other games.  What remains is the hardcore players, so those new to the game stand absolutely no chance.

The UBISOFT forums and youtube are full of these exact complaints, so check them out if you don't believe me before buying this game.

(Goes to show what the value of ridiculously ""protected"" games becomes in less than a year).

StarForce aside (and after subtracting 2 stars for its intrusive risk to our systems), this RTS seems undecided as to what it aimed for.
Trying to combine strategy with action is not new, WARCRAFT 3 (for one) did it much better. You have your hero (Alexander or Cleopatra) and then you build up your army to complete the corresponding campaign.
You build your base and your workers gather wood and gold. When strong enough you go (or get thrown) into battle - to earn the third resource: glory. All three are needed to advance to the next eras.

The graphics can be adequately good if run on high settings; low settings are pretty disappointing. The units are well designed though, and their movements and spilled blood give a realistic taste.

The controls will take you some time to get used to as, not only do they take up quite a chunk of the screen, but are temperamental in responding as well. Selecting units, especially in the heat of the battle, can be tricky too, as more often than not, workers receive by mistake the order to run into the front line and fight hand-to-hand with the armed enemy: an expensive short-lived sight.

The only thing that keeps this game afloat is, well, its naval warfare. Most RTS avoid them as too messy and complicated (haven't seen a solid effort since C&C: RED ALERT 2), however R&F:CaW demonstrates well designed ships, historically (more or less) accurate naval warfare techniques and quite enjoyable animations.

Beneath a load of pretentious storyline, there is an even bigger pile of redundant and frustrating gameplay. Regardless of the mission outline, what every one really entails is mowing down hordes upon hordes of enemies with either some type of gun, or a glaive-style weapon.

Every few missions you'll be faced with a ""new"" type of enemy which requires more than just holding down the fire button and moving from side to side. You might actually have to STOP holding the button long enough for its temporary invincibility to wear off, or be forced to use only your glaive. Just in case straying from the norm of button-holding proved too difficult, the game tells you the ""trick"" to beating the enemies each time.

I should have been suspicious the moment I saw the Koei logo, being as though that company only seems capable of making games where you fight millions of enemies endlessly (See Dynasty Warriors series). At least this one's not set to the backdrop of the Three Kingdoms period and has a story of its own, but unfortunately, it's scattered amongst quest after quest of mindless repetition.

Although the movies lacked production values, morals, and common sense, they were entertaining and fun.  WET captures that experience quite nicely.

Concept: 10/10
A beautiful girl in leather pants guns down 100 henchmen with a gatling gun while 50's Rock n' Roll plays in the background... suddenly the ""film"" breaks and you get a laughably bad and somewhat dirty commercial for hot dogs... when the 'movie' resumes, she's hacking up guys with a sword.  Action Packed + Sexy + Funny = Great Concept!

Story:  8/10
Rubi Malone has been betrayed by a crime syndicate full of degenerates and she wants her revenge.  Rubi is a loner and a hired gun who will do any dangerous job for the right price.  Scumbags die, limbs fall, heads roll, and cars explode.  Parts of this game will make you cringe, cheer, or laugh out loud.  Rubi Malone is voiced by Eliza Dushku, best known as Faith from Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Echo from Dollhouse.  She does a decent job, but the story would have been more entertaining if she acted a bit better or a bit worse (on purpose) and the script was more over-the-top.

Gameplay:  7/10
When the game first begins, only a few of Rubi's moves are available, so the game feels really clunky as some of the animation transitions are very rough.  The game sacrifices fluidity for speed, and for a ""Grindhouse"" style game, it's ok.  Rubi is armed with twin pistols and sword.  She faces mobs of henchmen and kills them by the dozens while using acrobatic props.  Whenever Rubi performs an acrobatic move (wall run, jump, pole swing, zip line, slide, dive...) the game slows down allowing the player to aim and become more effective at killing bad guys.  When Rubi is in this mode, she is much harder to hit.  With each bad guy she kills, a score multiplier increases, giving her more points per kill and boosts a healing factor.  The acrobatic, gun, sword, scoring system, and health regeneration features all combine to reward the player for aggression.  This isn't one of those duck behind a wall games... this is a kill the bad guys as fast and as cool as possible games.  As you get better at the combat and you unlock more moves, the game becomes really fun.  There is some depth here that you wouldn't expect.  At the end of each level, you get a score and you use those points to unlock new moves or improve Rubi's weapons.

Levels:  6/10
There are five different types of levels in the game.  They range from Great to Poor.

Arena levels are large areas loaded with gymnastic type ramps, walls, poles, etc... and they are laid out like Tony Hawk Style Tricklines.  As you play, you try to maximize the acrobatic moves as you kill the bad guys.  The level ends when you destroy a set number of enemy spawning points with your sword.  These are the best parts of the game!

Quicktime Sequences are also in this game.  Press the right button at the right time to watch Rubi do amazing stunts.  The timing is generous, but if you press the wrong button, you die.

Rubi Vision levels occur at set times and begin when Rubi shoots a guy and gets blood in her face.  These levels are cell shaded in red.  Rubi gets a decent healing factor and is rewarded for Chain Kills.  Basically, killing guys within 5 seconds of each other increases the counter.  If the timer runs out, the counter resets to zero.  The enemies have low HP, so these levels are a fun change of pace and reward aggression.

At certain points in the game, Rubi flashes back to her home base... a junkyard... where she runs through timed obstacle courses and shoots targets.  Every target shot takes 2 seconds off of her time.  If she completes the course fast enough, you earn a gold, silver, or bronze medal.  Because you don't have to do these over and over, they are kind of fun.

The worst levels in the game are platforming levels.  They are loaded with insta-deaths and you must restart them from not-so-generous checkpoints.  These go against the strengths of the game, which is the fast paced combat.

You cannot replay levels over again in the Story Mode, but there is a ""Points Mode"" where you can replay levels with maxed out abilities and weapons to try and achieve a high score.  If you perform badly in a level while you are in Story Mode and you don't earn enough points to upgrade Rubi, the remainder of the game will become much more difficult.

Graphics:  5/10
The environments are passable, but the character art looks dated.  The game gets away with this because it is a game based on low-budget movies.  There is also a ""scratchy film"" filter running over the art as you play, so the game does feel like you are watching an old bad movie.

Sound:  10/10
The explosions, gunfire, and screams of the dying punctuate the battles and the Tarantino-esque Soundtrack is perfect.  There's old school rock, surf guitar, and garage band music.  All of it delivers a perfect grindhouse atmosphere.

Humor:  8/10
This game will make you laugh out loud and shock you at its audacity.

Replay Value:  5/10
There are four difficulty levels and a special 1 bullet - 1 kill mode for the hardcore fans.  Aside from these and the ""challenge mode"" there really isn't any reason to replay the game and for most people, one time through will be enough.

Maturity:  M
The swearing in this game surpasses a biker bar on alimony night and there's enough killing in this game to fill a battlefield after a small scale war.  There is no sex or nudity, which was kind of surprising.  It's M-Rated because of the violence, blood, and language.

Overall:  7/10
This ends up being a good game for the same reason that you like ""good"" bad movies.  They aren't complex, they aren't pretty, and you just sit back, laugh, and have a good time.  The game lacks features, it's rough around the edges, and there are a few bugs.  But in the end, it manages to be fun.

Buy it cheap if you love action games or bad action movies and you understand that this is a ""Budget"" title.
Rent it if you have 6-8 hours to blow through the story mode.
Avoid it if you need high production values like Call of Duty, Halo, or Assassin's Creed.

If you enjoyed this game at all, get Bayonetta.  Bayonetta is more fluid, has high production values, it's sexier and funnier.

This became very frustrating with the bad camera angles and the fact that many of the save positions were no help at all.

That is all that you have to know about this game, is that it'll make you want to pull your hair out in frustration. If you want your sanity kept in check avoid this game at all costs.

The developers of this game show very well that they don't realize what actually counts in making a game fun, and that part is the fact that it has to be fun. Frustration only sits there to impede on this. There are numerous issues for this game and I'll explain the biggest ones below.

First and foremost, some of the 'checkpoints' wherein if you die you get ressurected to, at the end of the game are nigh and far between on the ""tanker"" level the second time you go in. You'll have a part wherein it's literally one minute time your movement perfectly or restart, then you have to jump perfectly or you'll fail and have to do that along with the one minute perfect moves again. Why they didn't make it so that you could go back to the jumping perfectly area again after you die is anyone's guess. I personally believe it's because they're idiots who don't know good QA.

The next biggest issue with thsi game is the minigames. They suck, plain and simple they suck. There is no ryhtm, there is rhyme there is no pattern. What they do is the equivalent of button mashing the controller at random intervals. This is how they do their ""minigames"". Some of them are optional, some are not. The ones that are not are the worst. The very end of the game you have one that is identical to one that you've already faced except it's a million times worse. It's pure button mashing with no pattern, at all, also no indication of progress. Also like the checkpoints in this game, minigames have none. And this is one of them, wherein if you mess up once, back to the beginning. You have to be able to handle the left/right hand of the screen top to bottom, along with being able to press all 8 of the face buttons at any given time without any messups!

Also driving any vehicle in this game is reminiscent of grand theft auto, except it's actually worse. And you have to repeatedly drive a vehicle to beat the game. So unless you like failing, time and time again, I'd avoid this game. If you are a glutten for punishment since the controls are horrible, then by all means enjoy this game.

This game has too many flaws to call it a good game. The issue here is how they designed it, and I cannot give it anything higher than 2 stars. If you take out the horrible minigames, and fix that there are badly placed checkpoints on one of the levels, and the horrible controls when piloting a vehicle then this is definately a 5 star game, the platforming is really fun, there is loads of humor and the levels are pretty well designed. But to summarize it again, avoid this game unless you're really into the jak and daxter series or are a glutten for punishemtn. I know that I'll never replay this game again, once I'm done thsi time it's going to sit on a shelf and colelct dust.

But it won't be as upsetting as this game is. There are certainly many people who will love this game, they have every right to give it full stars if they would like. I however, do not love it, and I have every right to give it less than full stars.

Now, my review:

This game is really, really hard. I have played dark souls for a total of 1-2 hours, I don't recall that being as hard as this. The first boss in dark souls took me a few tries before beating him, but I bought it when it had already been out for a few years and newer games distracted me from finishing the game. The bosses in this game have taken me 1-2 hours. I'm not sure I've ever been so frustrated with a game in my life. I, a grown man in my 30s, nearly started crying. It's that bad. Some people will read this and go ""this is my kind of game..."", but I feel like fair warning is in order.

People are saying this is easier than dark souls. They are bragging. They are bragging about their ability, which they likely gained by spending hours and hours developing motor memory as they played Dark Souls. I read that on IGN LoF was ""Dark Souls light"" so I felt pretty good about my purchase, I thought maybe this game would be playable for me. It is not. So far, it's harder than Dark Souls -- the part I played anyway.

For the record, I don't suck at video games. I am not amazing, but I have a gamerscore somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000, and I can compete effectively in every game I've played with other gamers. This game takes an absurd amount of patience and work. It feels like work. It makes me want to cuss like work. It just isn't that fun to die so much playing the same boss over and over. I don't mind a difficult challenge, but a video game should be challenging -- but achievable. It should actually be fun to do. If I wanted to bang my head against a wall I would go to work or call my ex-girlfriend. Games should be a release, not the most demanding task of my day. Learning Greek or going to work is easier. I did both this week and enjoyed it more (and succeeded more easily).

Bottom line? I blew good money on this game and I am just going to have to sell it back. I like to be challenged, but video gaming is supposed to be a way to rebuild your fragile ego after everything else in your day sucked, where you have to try but you know you will succeed after moderate set backs.

Again, some people will want this. They will relish the hours spent fighting one boss, or having spent hours mastering the play style in Dark Souls say things like ""man that was easy."" They will enjoy being in that part of the gaming community that relishes how hardcore it is. They can publish their own glowing reviews to balance mine -- but fair warning, this game may not be for you -- it's worth mentioning, since I know I'm not the only one to feel this way.

I rate the game overall 2 stars, though I have more or less hated it. It is a remarkable creation -- gorgeous setting, involving game-play, flawless engine that runs effortlessly. It does show off what the next-gen can do, and it shows off the remarkable talent of game makers. But I paid almost $70 for a game (I guess you can call it a game) that I am miserable playing and raises my blood pressure.

I did play it for a number of hours. Painful hours. Until I realized that I really wasn't having fun and just about everything else I've done this week was easier -- and far more productive. I'm going to go REST from this game by studying something, like perhaps Organic Chemistry or Rocket Science. Maybe I'll go take the MCAT. Just to relax my mind.

Talk about a let down. I restarted the game and this time it let me play. The main aspect of the game is a screen divided into sections (transportation, law, health, economy, etc.). In each section are policies, issues/concerns, and mainstays. By mainstay, I mean important aspects within the slice, such as poverty, crime, GDP, things of that nature. Making one policy decision usually impacts a number of issues and groups, as well it should. You are given a limited number of political capital each term, which is determined by your cabinet members. At any point you can replace a cabinet member to modify your political capital.

Objective: Remain president as long as possible.

Doing this sounds simply, gather at least 50% of the popular vote. Problem is, not everyone votes. You can have an overall positive rating for a group, but lose that group in the election. This makes sense, but the game does a poor job or describing how to prevent this from happening. There have been times where almost all groups approved me at least 50% and I still lost the vote. Why you ask? It doesn't tell you. In this way, the game seems flawed to me.

Extras: At any point you can add policy items to switch things up a bit. You are not limited to what you start off with. To me, this makes the game a lot more interesting and replayable. Unfortunately, the tutorial didn't cover it very well and I only figure it out by clicking on everything in order to obtain a better understanding.

Overall: The game can be fun to play, but it crashes every second round. If you don't mind reloading the program, go for it. But this frustrates the snot out of me. On the plus side, it does have an autosave feature, so you cannot lose your entire game in case of a crash. The major downside (besides crashes) is the difficulty to be reelected. Out of around 10 games, I've been relected for a second term once! This leads me to believe, I suck as president, at least by this game's definition.","Decent, but not great",1345161600,,,

The answer, unfortunately is no. DanceDanceRevolution's debut on the PS3 does a few things that the series has never done before, but at the expense of some massive cuts and other bad design decisions that make it quite a departure from even say the PS2 versions of the last decade.

Let's talk about the good. DanceDanceRevolution is one pretty looking game. For the first time in the series, DanceDanceRevolution is finally in 720p HD with a silky smooth 60 frames per second (the Universe games on the Xbox 360 are sub-HD and run at a much lower frame rate). Colors trully pop out here and when you hit the arrows in perfect timing, the explosions simply are pure eye-candy. The game's stock background videos provided by Imagica are well detailed, well animated, and can distract your dancing with how elaborate they perform. An optional 576 MB install ensures that the game also performs quickly. In fact, how the game performs is DanceDanceRevolution's strongest aspect. Developer Genki is responsible for developing this game on the PS3, a company known for their arcade-style racing games that run in smooth 60 frames.

The gameplay still retains the traditional DDR gameplay with a few new things added to spice things up. As usual, the game comes with a standard soft DDR-controller that you connect to your PS3 via-USB. If you have an older PS3 model with 4 USB slots you can easily play a 4 player dance off, however, like me, if you only have two slots, you probably have to buy an adapter that will equip more dance pads. DanceDanceRevolution on the PS3 also includes support for the PlayStation Move motion controller. Support for the Move is pretty standard as you use your wand to hit round notes that appear on screen.

DanceDanceRevolution comes with your standard array of modes with a few ommisions which is a complete disappointment for many veteran DDR players. Gone here includes EDIT MODE, any form of a standard NONSTOP/ONI modes, ONLINE PLAY and LEADERBOARDS found on the Xbox 360 itterations, real on-screen 3D polygonal dancers, and an 8-PANNEL DOUBLE MODE where one player manages 2 dance pads.

To combat some of these shortcomings, Konami has added a few things to the DDR format. Most of these are great introductions while some leave a lot to be desired. Perhaps the game's best new feature is the abilty to record gameplay and share them to friends online. Privided that the song you want to share online belongs to Konami, you can record your mad DDR skills and export them out of the game as a small 26-32 MB MPEG video format. You can upload the video via the PS3 to either youtube or Facebook or export them further to a USB device and upload them from your PC.

DOUBLE MODE has been replaced as OCTO-MOVE, a haphazard replacement, this mode turns the face buttons (X, Square, Triangle, and Circle) in your dance pad as diagonal arrows. Only the CHALLENGE difficulty supports this mode which has to be unlocked by completing a standard song's EXPERT difficulty.

Taking cues from DJ MAX and Guitar Hero franchises, when your dance guage is fully filled, you can activate GROOVE TRIGGER (which can be executed by sliding your foot from an arrow to a face button on a dance pad). This trigger does three things to the gameplay. 1. It depletes your dance gauge to 50%. 2. Durring this sequence, you get bonus points for every step you hit the mark (around 50% more than usual). And 3, any miss steps you make durring this sequence will greatly deplete your dance guage so be careful not to activate this mode on tricky parts of a song. GROOVE CHAIN is taken from the Guitar Hero games where arrows in FLAT colors will have circles in them. Hit every note in this chain to get a few extra bonus points.

So I've covered a lot about this game and have left one major factor for the last. How's the music? Well, it's a product of the Hottest Party line of DDR games so it means low song counts, some astoundingly bad licensed songs, and some of the best KONAMI ORIGINAL efforts in the series. The music overall would be best described as a mixed bag. I'm not just gonna stop there, this game is like one huge roller coaster when it comes to the music.

Firstly, you have 20 licensed songs on the disc. Most of these songs are astoundingly BAD, therefore, making them the worst songs in the game. Included in these are Natasha Bedingfield's sleepy ""Love like this"", Jason Mraz's mind-numbing ""I'm yours"", Gorillaz's creepy and slow ""Plastic Beach"", and the highly unfitting ""Missing"" from the amazing British duo Everything But The Girl. There's some Emo pop rock garbage here from Paramore and Orianthi to please the wrist slitters. The quality of these songs is subjective person-to-person. However, it is universally agreed that these songs simply do not fit the game. Perhaps if they were club version remixes (like the version of Natasha Bedingfield's ""Unwritten"" was featured in SuperNOVA 2) it would have been acceptable but that ain't the case.

I did enjoy very few of the licensed selections particularly the game's most popular song which is Lady GaGa's amazing dance hit ""Bad Romance"". Another odd yet great pick is Ke$ha's last track in her debut album Animal called, ""Animal"". The oldest song in the game is ""Dancing in the street"" from Martha and the Vandellas which I quite enjoy and fits the game quite nicely.

The rest of the list are KONAMI's own original music. This set is particularly strong among fans with great new selections from well established Konami musicians. NAOKI perhaps has done some of his finest work in this game with the game's theme song ""LET'S GET AWAY"" along with a EUROBEAT sensation ""Find your way"" and the symphonic speed opera called ""Until the End"". Musicians who made sub-standard DDR debuts from DDR X return with this version. Fearing how bad they would sound, I actually was pleasantly surprised with DKC Crew's ""Rhythms Inside"", Bill Hamel redeems himself with an amazing smooth dance music track ""The way U move"" (not to be confused with the same as Outkast's single of the same name).

After one MAJOR false start, again thanks to KONAMI, DLC music is now available. 7 packs are available. 6 of them you have to pay for and are all repeated material, the 7th being a free pack of long version songs that are featured in the main game. 33 additional songs can be added to the game's 50 included.

To wrap this up DDR on the PS3 is not a very strong first outing for this veteran series. A lot of new ideas were thrown at the expense of old features being thrown out.  I firmly believe that this could have been a good game without DDR X2 AC helping it.

Resident Evil Code: Veronica X balances out somewhere in the middle, and Capcom needs to cleanup the problems before it continues to go on to make another one in this series.  There's not much new from the previous games besides a storyline.
On its good notes, the game does have a strong storyline with impressive cut scenes.  It does a superb job of creating a creepy environment for you to play in.  I usually play games late at night in the dark, but I honestly had to keep the lights on while playing this one to help tone down the spookiness of it.  Entering rooms and hearing the moan of zombies that can't be scene ate away at my sanity.
Unfortunately, this is one of the few games I didn't play through to the end.  I rented it for a week, and have no intent to buy it or rent it again.  The action was very slow paced throughout the game, and needed to be because of the horrible controls.  Up walks forward and right and left turn.  That's fine if the camera is behind your character, but when the camera angle switches you need to do some quick mental gymnastics to figure out which way left or right is.
Shooting zombies is fun, but there's no intelligent or tricky combat.  You'd have to rotate all the way around (there's a hotkey for it), push forward and pray there are no obstacles or camera angle switches.  The controls are just too hard to handle when attempting to do anything fast paced.  The static camera angles are very bad.  The moan of zombies lets you know they're in the room, but you often cannot see them because of the poorly positioned camera.  You either have to fire at off-screen enemies or wander closer hoping the camera will switch.
Don't forget to respect the glass.  While guns can make zombies meet their end, they can't break windows or mirrors.  You have a limited number of bullets and should guard them carefully.  This is especially annoying with rooms where enemies will magically come back to unlife when you walk out and back in because you have to waste more bullets re-killing them.
If you're a fan of the series or enjoy slower paced games with strong stories and good graphics this game is for you.  If you're an action junky, this game doesn't deliver and you should take a look at Onimusha or Devil May Cry.",Keep Improving Please,1005436800,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Halo 3, I could play for hours on end(and spent many a night up all night until the morning playing). This game, I am so bored of it in under an hour that it feels like I was robbed for actually paying for it. I have gotten more enjoyment out of games on the xbox arcade and the indie games for less than a third of the price of this game.

The campaign: About 6 hours for me. I was playing on heroic difficulty. I could have beat it faster, but I wanted to watch all the cut scenes. The story was cheesy. I felt NO connection to the characters at all. I felt like any bit of emotion they were trying to get from me was forced.

The multiplayer: Where to begin on this abomination? The guns are terrible. To anyone who actually knew how to use a BR, forget it, it is gone. They have replaced it with the DMR. A one shot, underpowered piece of garbage that sprays wildly if you try to shoot it quick. If you shoot it at about 2 shots every 3 seconds, it will stay fairly accurate. It feels to me like they just wanted to slow the gameplay of an already slow game down even more. Also, the map selection is TERRIBLE. This game comes with 9 maps, and a few are remakes of old maps. I believe Halo 3 came with 11 when new. Out of these 9, I feel like I play three or four maps repeatedly. That is boring. I want a wide variety. Also, the fact that Bungie has already released a map pack for it is just plain insulting. I just spent $60 on the game, and now you want me to buy a $10 map pack less than 3 months after the game came out?! That tells me Bungie had no respect for the buyers, but instead, held out on the maps so they could milk more money out of a horrific game. Bungie, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Next is the spawning. I have literally had an enemy spawn within melee distance of me after I had just killed them. That is worse than in any COD game, and I AM NOT a COD fan. Also, another complaint about the weapons. Where are they on the maps? There are nearly no weapons anywhere. It was like Bungie just forgot about them.

Firefight: It is what it is. You face round after round of Covenant troops. Pretty self explanatory. This may honestly be the most enjoyable part of the game.

Forge: I don't care for it. I actually preferred the forge from halo 3. That being said, many people love the new forge.

Theater: This is a train wreck and then some. Do you want to make a clip of an awesome kill you got? You can do that! Do you want to save that for some fun memories? You can do that too! Want to get some friends in and watch the clip together? You CAN'T do that! Theater only supports 1 person. This will not be changed, as that ""would have been too hard to code"" as Bungie says. I find that absurd, as it is nothing new. It has been done in the Halo series before. Why couldn't they just rehash that code and send it out again?

Custom games: They are custom games. You make the rules. Not a lot I can really say here. Make it what you want.

All in all, I give this game 2 stars. I feel I can only give it a 1 star rating if the game is absolutely unplayable. This is on the verge of that, but the custom games and firefight save it. The other reason I give it 2 stars is because it makes for a great coaster so I don't have to worry about any sweat from a glass causing my table to get spots in it.

However the game doesn't appear to have been thoroughly tested, because after installing it, I found that the lifetime reward that I use a lot- No Jealousy ceased to function. This is because Generations has updated the game to include an intrusive new  called ""romantic reputation."" Romantic rep, gives your sim a reputation score based on how many romances your sim currently has. Problem is- this new play device is very sensative. Your sim can get a bad rep if their spouse DIES and is a ghost! Or if you have a love interest in HS that your sim never bothered to break up with. This can effectively destroy your sim's relationship by forcing the Sims's spouse spontaneously accuse them of cheating and break up. Sims also gets bad reputations for being non-monogamous which is simply way too paternalistic for my taste especially for unmarried Sims. In real life a person can date more than one person without being a 'cheater.' Or a gay partner can have children with the straight roommate. However with generations utter monogamy seems to be the only option. I really dislike that. Who and what is considered romantic cheating should be up to the player. It is as bad as the 'celebrity rumors' introduced in Late Night where a sim got a bad moodlet form having a child out of wedlock. This isn't the 1940's. I don't need the game passing judgment on my sims. I want to decide if they breakup or consider their spouse a cheat.

The other thing I dislike about Generations is the way EA implemented memories. It is very poorly done. Basically, memories is purely cosmetic, it takes small thumbnails of such events as: ""Burned the toast"" and ""Danced the Smustle"" and captures them in a scrapbook. The game constantly prompts you to spam your facebook page with these ridiculous events. The memories DON'T have any game impact, so it is basically a cosmetic feature which makes the game run slow and advertises sims for EA. I don't think it is cool that EA is using players to advertise their games! Fortunately, you can turn the feature off in options.. But memories are still being saved, and this feature slows down your game, and creates larger and larger save files.

I do like some of the new features. The imaginary friend is cute, and the new interactions with children are great. There is also a tremendous amount of stuff for children and teens to play with including a tree house, waterslide, and toybox with costumes.

Overall, I just didn't like it. If they had taken out the romantic rep, and the other elements which remove free choice from players such as the antonymous breakups etc. I would like it more.

I love WCW Mayhem by Electronic Arts, and that was their first wrestling game, and this is their second , but it is something that you dig out of a litter box. I don't like this game because there are only about four weapons laying around and when you use a weapon about three times it turns into dust and that makes it impossible to win a first blood match (they're nearly impossible to win with weapons anyways). Also, the backstage areas that you have to wrestle in are smaller than the wrestling ring itself. There are only about two moves that you can do besides punching and kicking and you have to win a match, which is almost impossible, to unlock a new move. It is also very confusing to even start a match on this game. The graphics would look better if you cracked the television screen with a hammer. WCW Nitro is better than this game.

And while it seems to do a great job of theming the game up with transformers, it never really feels like Transformers to me. It feels like an action arcade game with Transformers slapped on it really really well. But transformers never fought like this or were in high speed adrenaline chases. Thematically I think transformers would be a better rpg game or adventure game. In this game we have Optimus floating in air while doing attacks and flinging his vehicle self at robots. So while they do a great job at trying to make the theme apply it never sticks, despite the really incredible character models and voice acting.

The game itself is bland. I feel like I've played games like it back on the n64, just much slower, but with the same amount of camera angles, depth, and lack of thought out features. For instance, I tried to change the difficulty level and it warned me it would restart the chapter. It hadn't actually introduced chapters at that point so I assumed it was check points, and this ended up making me restart the game. The game isn't fun. It's repetitive. And the levels are boring, ugly, and visually empty as if it were designed for ps2. If you are a transformers fan I feel you are much better off playing the high moon studios games, despite it not having the amazing G1 presentation.

I'd watch a new cartoon with those character models though. But even at the psn sale cost of $17 this was not worth my money or time. I hope it leads to better titles by a different studio.",Not up to par.,1461456000,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'},

Pros:
- Flying, it is awesome.
- Some, less than half, boss fights are really cool, especially the one from Ancient Cistern.

Cons:
- Dungeons are nothing special
- You run after Zelda the whole game, from first temple to last. THAT is the whole story, you following her and never catching up until the end.
- Main antagonist is lame with no backstory.
- Final boss is not Ganondorf nor anyone really important, just some guy that appears at the end, which is supposedly the root of all evil in subsequent games, but otherwise the enemy has no real story either, just a reference to one.
- Nothing special about the items you use.
- Game doesn't build any emotional connection within you with the places and people you meet.
- Game world is not open, you fly down a section, and the only way to get to another section is to fly up and down the other.
- End game doesn't make sense, you finally travel in time, but you can't go anywhere else in the world but the temple, totally defeating the purpose of you being in a different time period.

I was really excited about the game when I first played it, but within a week of installing it, I realized that it just wasn't all it was made up to be by all the hype.
The world is expansive, yes. In fact, its overwhelming. The landscapes look great and the enviornmental and weather effects are amazing. The problem with this gigantic world is that it is sparsely populated. You only see signs of life when you go into towns or dungeons. Most of the time the wilderness is uninhabited. And that makes the game lonely. In fact, this game is like playing Ever Quests and other similar massive online games...except you are the only player. There is no one else. And that gets lonely. Why a multi-player option was not included is beyond comprehension.
The character models are quite possibly the ugliest character models I have ever seen in a game. The faces are hideous, and all the models look deformed and blocky. This is not because of a system configuration (my computer running top of the line hardware), it is just horrible character design. Further adding to the feeling of repetition, there are only about 5 or 6 different faces per race, further split up between gender. So, with hundreds of NPC's in the game, you see the same faces repeated...ALOT. Not only are all the faces and character models virtually identical, but they all repeat the same text over and over. Although there is a long and involved story in the game, I could never follow it. I didn't find it interesting at all, and frankly, since every character said virtually the same thing, after a while I just found myself not really caring what NPC's said. I ignored them completely. That made the game utterly boring. Maybe its my own fault, but I honestly just got sick of reading the same text over and over from the repetetive NPCs.
Creating your character is probably the only entertaining thing about this game. You have the option to pick a pre-existing class, have a custom class created for you by answering questions, or creating your very own class, mixing any abilities that you wish. There are multiple races to choose from, each having unique abilities that set them apart from one another. Picking your appearence is pointless, simply because there aren't many choices, and they all look the same. Plus, you'll see whatever face you pick for yourself repeated over and over in the game on the NPCs, as I mentioned earlier.
Upping your skills in the game is simple enough, though it takes hours and hours. If you have the time--and high boredom threshold--you could stand in one spot using your skills over and over and get them up. Using your skills over and over is the only way to advance them, and until you find heavy combat areas, you won't advance much at all.
Despite the amazing environmental graphics and weather effects, great ambient sound and sense of exploration, Morrowind just doesn't really cut it. I found the music to be repetetive and dull. There is alot to do in the game, but quests just seem so empty. Of the few quests that I did, I never once got a feeling of satisfaction upon completion. In the end it just felt like more mundane tasks to do, and that made it boring.
The heavily touted World Editor allows you to do all types of things, editing almost anything about the game.  You could build your very own world if you had the time and patience.  Oh, and did I mention you need a degree in Quantum Physics to even comprehend how complex the editor is?  Only die-hard, heavily devoted users who would forsake everything else in their life and spend countless hours, days, even weeks trying to learn and master the editor should bother with it.  It is definitely not for the casual editor, or someone with a remote interest in tinkering with the game.
If you have countless hours to devote to this game, then you might find it enjoyable. Frankly, I just do not have the time or patience to devote to the game...and it quite simply does not live up in any way to the tremendous hype it received. If the game DID live up to its hype, then I would enjoy it...then I would find the time to devote to this game. In the end, I found it to be nothing more than a repetetive, boring, and dreary gameplay experience. Morrowind should only be played by fanatic, hardcore RPG players.

In this game, however, it wears thin very quickly, especially in the Boss battles, where one hit is often enough to send Wario flying off the screen, making it almost impossible to beat any given boss in less then seven tries.
The game's level design must've looked good on paper, but is very poorly executed. You must go through each stage four or five times to find all the keys, chests and tresaures. Time of day is factored as well, and after finding a tresure almost every stage in the game is radically changed. For example, find the seeds in one level, and now there are huge vines growing everywhere in the levels you've already completed, allowing access to new areas and items. It can get very repetitives very quickly.
Also, for some reason, Warioland 3 has the worst graphics of the series. The first game even looks better. Backgrounds are almost nonexistant, textures are bland, and, although this game was the first made specifically for the Game Boy Color, Wario is made up of only two colors. Huh?

The one I received, though brand new, starts out sounding as if the fans are really struggling to get up and running. Once they have ""stretched"" (as I have called it) the fans are not terribly noisy, but I am aware to some people any decibel rise is unacceptable.

In my opinion, the largest downfall is that the item appears to be making heat flow less productive. My theory is that the PS3s stock cooling is faster and more efficient than the additional hardware. If the fans are attached when I approach the system after shutdown I can feel (though have never officially measured) the increased heat at the rear of the PS3. I have considered the possibility this could simply result from the push of hot air out. However, not only is this emanating heat increased from instances where I have the fans off, but it significantly climbs the moment I proceed to remove the cooling expansion. This was glaringly noticeable when I needed to pull the exhaust for the purpose of disconnecting my LAN. My assumption is that the stock cooling is pushing harder than Nyko's intercooler can keep pace with. I feel it is essentially forcing a bottleneck thereby preventing the heat itself from be sent directly out of the console's shell.

Perhaps I just received a weak specimen, but I really feel this product is more of a threat to the rig than an asset. Once my Nyko fans have done their ""stretching"" it seems like the attachment is running at 100% of its capabilities. Aside from the noisy start I have no evidence to the contrary that my intercooler is performing at its intended standard.

As you can likely imagine, this fan expansion has been permanently purged from use on my PS3. It will never see use again in my home. In fact, if I could give it to any of you, I would gladly upon request. This is one of those products I just consider a loss and a learning experience. I hope some shopper(s) get more satisfaction and utility out of the device than my abode. As far as recommendations/reviews go; I can only wish I had acquired this purchase sooner. Maybe then my cautionary words might have actually served to have helped someone out in their decision of whether or not the device is beneficial.

There's always been a problem with Mario games concerning the controls, they're slippery and not responsive enough for the difficulty of the game. Also the fact that the only attack Mario can do is jump on his enemies, at least in this game which isn't enough arsenal for the amount of enemies that are set against you at one time (armies of them). I know people who have been stuck on the same level for years and it makes me wonder why people bother with this game.

Another dire problem is the process of saving your game. The game only lets you save at designated points instead of saving at the completion of each level which again makes this game seem frustrating when you complete a substantial amount of the game and suddenly die and get sent back five to eight levels for losing all your lives.

I would've given the game 2 stars for the graphics alone which look somewhat advanced for 1991 but there are so many games from the 16 bit era that surpassed it that I'm going to ignore the graphics in this review because they simply don't make up for its lack of detail and intuitiveness in everything else. In comparison to Donkey Kong Country and Sonic The Hedgehog 3 this game is dwarfed for its graphics. Another reason to overlook the graphics is the blending of levels in which the same type of level looks nearly identical to every level of its kind.

And let's not forget the overrated soundtrack. The music is dull, repetitive, and juvenile and not in good way. It's not uncommon to hear the same music being played for three or more consecutive levels which is  ridiculous because they didn't even do this on the NES.

The gameplay is pretty dang good, it pulls off shooting really well with the limited (1 analog stick) controls of the PSP, and the combat can be really fun. You can upgrade guns and acquire different gear which adds to the fun of combat.
The unique gameplay mechanic is that you can jump from person to person controlling them. So if you're about to die, quantum leap to your buddy and you're still okay. Or if you need to get behind a weakspot or something.

The story has nothing to do with Parasite eve and honestly poor regardless of ties to the series. The ending (no spoilers) ruins things even further especially when you consider the main character and the unlockable shower cutscenes that sorta paint a bad picture (when you tie the ending and it's meaning to this).

The story as a whole comes off as a Sci-fi Channel movie, or basically: Poorly written to the point it's funny.

Enemies are anonymous blobs with no character to them, they honestly come off like bullseye targets with how some of them are designed. And the other issue is; they have nothing to do with the Parasite Eve lore.

The voice acting is a mixed bag with characters saying things that are useful and obvious and repetitive. Aya being the worst one by far, to me it just felt like another strong female lead being written as a weak scared little girl (much how Samus in Other M was written).

I have no idea why they called this Parasite Eve when there's no ties to the original beyond a few call backs, if they called this Monster Shooter it'd probably have been better off and not gotten glares from PE fans and also might have had a better chance at a better story.

When you see Rockstar and film noir in the same sentence, you can't help but get excited, but my excitement quickly turned to anguish as I tried to finish this arduous and dull game.

The graphics are tremendous in terms of facial recognition and voice acting. This will become the new standard in gaming. while the character model bodies are okay to good, the faces are actual actors giving performances with nuance and subtlety that is simply unmatched in gaming. In a game where you play a detective endlessly questioning and interrogating townsfolk, you need to be able to read between the lines. LA Noir succeeds here, and if the game was a demo at a convention, you'd be happy with it.

Problem is, the game is much longer than a demo, and the redundant format of crime scene investigation and interrogation just become too much like work, and so you end up losing interest quickly by blowing through some of the questioning just to see what happens next. This is not the intended way to play the game, but it just doesn't move fast enough to hold most people's interest.

Kane has apparently returned; twice.  Or three times.  Maybe seventeen.  The campaign is all Nod, and skips twice; once taking place before C&C3 campaign, once taking place during it, and once taking place 5 years later.

As masterfully rapturing as Joseph Kucan is at portraying Kane to a degree where you stare him right in the eyes and never blink, the story he's given here reeks of staleness, as in concert with the C&C3 Nod campaign, you begin to think Kane is a two-trick pony whose plans always consist of preaching to his ""children"" and making them feel happy and loved, then making them do stupid things to completely eviscerate any advantage over GDI they may have had, or butcher thousands of their own soldiers pointlessly, as nothing more than ""tests of faith"".  It's on display here a few more times from the C&C3 campaign.

Kane seemingly has no real plan in this expansion pack; it changes as frequently and readily as the wind, and there's always someone new to betray him, because apparently all Kane likes to do is push his ""children"" until they say no, and he kills them for treachery.  The plots for the expansion pack are rather like TNA Wrestling booking; neither one has much connection to the other, and seem to have been randomly hatched out of convenience.

The first act of the story is obvious in Kane trying to reunite Nod and strengthen it secretly.  The second act involves you, as the computer system LEGION, doing random things in the midst of the original C&C3 campaign, as well as some extraneous work for Alexa.

Spoilers follow.

Act 3 steers wildly off-course, and seems almost to retcon the entire events of the C&C3 campaign.  Whereas C&C3 ended with Nod having secured an alien tower to go through and explore the universe, Act 3 here is 5 years after that, and Nod is still on Earth, and Kane is somehow HAPPY that virtually all his generals have been killed and GDI pretty much controls the planet once again.

Also, they apparently lost the tower or something, because it's never even once mentioned.  The entire story now revolves around a poorly explained ""Tacitus"" which I only know what it is because I watched some cutscenes from C&C Tiberian Storm, and a cyborg army Kane had apparently been hiding underground China and Russia for 50 years or so.  There is a huge build-up to these cyborgs and how they will be Nod's vengeance and Nod's resurgence and how LEGION will be connected with them to form some kind of insane military force under your command.

The next mission, it's discovered that these cyborgs are little more than infantry soldiers.  Soldiers only slightly more powerful than regular militants.  They replace the militants and the fanatics, but they're pretty much useless on their own, so as usual they're little more than a wasted novelty, and you'll be right back to your backbone of rocket troopers, stealth tanks, and avatars and the like.

Gameplay is completely the same as in the original, and unlike expansion packs like ""Yuri's Revenge"", which completely revamped Soviet technology and added a whole new faction, this expansion pack isn't even at the level of ""Starcraft: Brood War"" in terms of gameplay change.

The only differences thus far have been unit replacements with ""beta"" versions, or ""super"" versions (that somehow existed during C&C3 and were more powerful than their original bases, yet never ever deployed), such as a beta version of the Avatar, or a super Juggernaut which is immobile.

Outside of the campaign, the only major difference I've noticed is the addition of infantry transport for Nod, and every faction getting a SUPER DUPER UUPER TRUUPER unit, in something of the same vein as the Titans in ""Age of Mythology: The Titans"".

This leads to game balance: The game balance is terrible.  Simply terrible, perhaps worse.  Considering how little this expansion pack changes gameplay, gameplay balance issues also apply to the original game.

GDI is the superpower faction in this game and expansion pack.  Period.  Nothing else can compete on their level.

The Scrin, for all their doomsday presence and sudden shocking appearance and seeming invincibility, are in actuality the equivalent of the Zerg (from Starcraft) without Hydralisks or Ultralisks; they are a two legged dog with missing teeth.  They don't have any heavy units except the Tripods and the Aircraft capital ships, which despite their immense firepower, are ridiculously low on HP, meaning that unless you research shielding for them, they will be picked off against a hefty GDI base defense.

The Brotherhood of Nod has plenty of novelty and expertly wielded stealth technology, though in the end their army is essentially broken, as their only efficient anti-air ground unit is the Stealth Tank, and while the Avatar (and the SUPER DUPER UUPER Titan unit the Redeemer) are big and scary and can soup themselves up by scavanging from friendly units, they are ultimately cannon fodder in comparison to their GDI equivalents.

Despite the massive size and massive cost and massive armor hull for the Redeemer, it is a weak lump of crap compared to its GDI equivalent, the MARV, most especially due to the fact that its fire rate is the slowest of any Nod unit in the game, and only about 3 or 4 times more powerful than a normal Avatar's base laser.

And so in the base game and the expansion pack, GDI is the super-duper-superpower powerhouse, with all the best weapons and best armor and best units for utterly dominating and crushing the opponents.","Kane is back, but who cares?",1229126400,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

To be honest, the game is okay.  Rather than just having a game like a shooting gallery they try to make a story and give some purpose to what you are doing.  But in the end, most of the time the game plays like a rail shooter where the actions comes and goes off the screen and you don't have to move about in the game.  But like I said you get a story with what is going on in the screen, which can be nice for some.  There are some more generic challenges and safari type shoots if you don't want to deal with the story mode (Which you can also skip through).

The hardware is the real failure on this though.  You have the gun, but you also have to install a sensor bar on top of or below your television screen, it requires batteries (Not included) and then I believe syncs with the gun.  It only has an on button and a sleep timer, nothing else.  They couldn't think to put an actual on off switch on this?  Then I was excited to use the gun like a real gun and aim down the sights, but the sights never line up with what is on the screen, it just moves the symbol/reticle around the screen.  So what is the use of having a cool looking gun what senses your heart beat if you can't aim down the sights?  Also I had problems with the sensor turning off randomly.  I tried to figure out what was going wrong but the instructions (While written in 8 different languages was pretty minimalist,) offered no help.

So even with limited play modes I was hoping to have this maybe be a fun party game, but no luck.  The hardware problems and lack of imagination in using the game means it will probably just stay on the shelf.

This controller is awesome, but the reason I am only giving it 2 stars is, no matter how awesome something is, it should not break or be faulty after 1 month of use.

So, in other words, if i was trying to aim down my sights, I would be popping in and out of my sights really fast while holding down the left trigger.  I thought it might be lag, so i switched servers and the same thing happened to me.  I also tried the trigger in other games and it was faulty in those games as well.  Another problem I started to notice just after 2 weeks of use, is my right analog stick would start to be very stiff to move without me even adjusting the tension on it.  I would have to wiggle it back and forth really fast to ""loosen"" it up which was very weird to me.  I should have read reviews on this thing before I bought it because to me, taking this thing back constantly, and having to buy a new extended warranty at some stores if you were to get it at like Best Buy, just isn't worth it to me.  This is very sad because I absolutely have always loved Razer products, and this controller was sick.  Hopefully Razer will fix the quality of the build or whatever is causing all of these controllers to break so easily, or even ship broken, because when they do, I will for sure buy another one.

Yes you can also do away with the cable connecting your controller to your headset but the loss of sound clarity and easy access to mute and chat volume controls make this a definite lose lose situation.

Several ergonomic design failures with the XP500 force you to struggle when trying to locate a button on your headset.  While I had to do just that with the X4 to control game volume, the designers made the buttons on the XP500 small and in most instances flush with the casing on the earpieces.  The game volume control is a small wheel on the left earpiece and the chat volume a rocker switch on the right earpiece, neither lending themselves to easy manipulation during a chaotic battle.  The makers tout the ability to quickly switch form one sound preset to another while in the game to select the perfect sound system for the style of play that you need, I'm afraid that is not going to happen.  This control is one of several buttons on the bottom of your earpiece and is flush with the casing, good luck trying to find it and rotate through the selections trying to find the one you need without losing track of the game going on around you.  Several problems that have been with the system from the start have still not been addressed, the ear cups are still too small, the padding is hardly plush, and the cups are very shallow.  At this price these are hardly for children, so why not design them for the adults that are going to be using them?

As far as the sound quality of the preset selections, they may be a fantastic example of sound filtering, but it doesn't quite come off as described in the advertising.  When you need to hear the footsteps of approaching opponents, they aren't amplified, everything else is knocked down leaving you with a distorted flat unpleasant game sound, not what I want to hear when using 260.00 dollar headphones.

I honestly think the overall sound quality is better through my four year old X4's, the sound is richer and more balanced, and there is definitely less to hassle with as far as controls go on the X4.  I guess I'll stick with them and order as many spare puck cables as I can while they are still available.

So you're getting a game, the Kinect sensor (which will probably sell for over $100 by itself) for only $50 more than this.  Even if you go by the Titanfall bundle's regular price of $499, the value of this SKU is still worse.  So don't mistake this for a price drop, it's an un-bundling/cheaper SKU.

At 399, you really have to consider the PS4 as well.  It has more powerful hardware for the same price, which means most multiplatform games will look better and/or perform better on PS4, and multiplatform games make up for ~90% of both system's software libraries.  If Xbox One exclusives interest you more, then it's a decent system.

The stealth action and gadgets not to mention it's emphasis on  avoidance and evasion game play made it unique. Sadly all that made Splinter Cell stand out is gone and it's been turned into a hybrid rip off of Gears of Wars and Call of Duty. Killing is the emphasis in the single player campaign, so much so that the developers have even automated the process with the new ""Mark and Execute"" feature that allows you to select up to 4 bad guys and press one button then sit back and watch Sam kill in a slow motion bullet time splatterfest. Forget about catching and disabling an enemy, now Sam just goes for blood. You can sneak up on a guard but your options now are kill him or capture him then kill him or use him as a human shield then kill him. Sam can't use a whistle or pickup and throw objects to distract or lure guards as in the past. No longer do you hide bodies either. Just as with all the other shooters just stroll into a room go on a killing rampage and exit the other side, rinse and repeat. Gone is any thought required to evade and/or capture. No need to hack or pick locks anymore either, that too would take to much time away from the killing! Sam's rapages are aided by a new ""duck and cover"" style system that makes the game feel like a Gears of War rip-off rather then a Splinter Cell game. The levels are now much more arcade like and closed off similar to the Call of Duty series. This detracts from the open world feel of the previous games in the series.

On the plus side, gone are the simplistic busy work mini games that the developers either thought were really cool or tried to use as filler for the previous Splinter Cell Double Agent.

For real fans of Sam Fisher Splinter Cell Conviction will likely disappoint. It's dumbed down and is no longer a stealth action game but has become a third person shooter.

You can't upgrade existing weapons with new scopes or larger magazines, If you want something with a better scope you have to get an entirely new weapon.

Like to snipe? Don't bother. They did not add an orange icon above heads to spot someone from far way, the opposing teams do not look different to easily tell between a team mate and an enemy.

The upgrade system is total s***! It takes hours in some cases to rank up. Once someone is shooting at you forget about running once they have you in their sights by the time the first round hits you you're already dead.

What completely ruins this game is the design.  The designers appear to be following the rule, ""do not ever, EVER allow the player to have more than five seconds of fun.""  The missions are dull and linear, often being too hard at the end of 5 minutes of boring flying from place to place, and when you fail one you have to sit there for 30 seconds while it reloads and you have to do it all over again.

First, the CE items: I love all of them except for the arm band. I can appreciate what they were trying to do when they decided to include it, but it's too cheesy, too bulky, and it isn't something that I think belongs on display or in practical use. Otherwise, I loved everything else: the art book, the poster, the season pass (if you enjoy the game, this is great to have), and the watch is okay. I did a YouTube video of me unboxing the CE. Amazon deleted the link, though.

The watch looks good, but you get what you pay for. The CE (or the Sleeper Agent Edition) was $159.96 when I bought it. You are paying $59.99 for the base game. I would think that the art book would be worth about $20. So, now you're up to $79.99 in value (or $80 to be easy). The poster would be worth about $5; so, that's now about $85. The season pass is going for about $40. Now, we're up to $125 of value in this The Division Collector's Edition. Plus, there was about $15 worth (in my estimation) of DLC items included - skins, weapons, etc. So, that's about a $140 value so far. That means that there's about $20 worth of value left unaccounted for. That's essentially what you're paying for this watch, and that's essentially the quality you're getting in that watch. The physical design is cool. It's made out of a hard metal-like material (the texturing is odd...not quite metal, but not plastic or rubber, either). It has a nice weight to it; but, the time only shows when you hit a button and the orange ring light only turns on when you hit that same button. As far as features on the watch, they are very standard: time, date, and a stopwatch.

Lastly, the game:

I won't go into too much detail about it (because there really is soooo much that could be said about both the good and bad), but initially, I really LOVED this game. However, it was and seems to continue to be absolutely plagued with bugs, glitches, and too many opportunities for those inclined to take advantage of unintentionally broken mechanics. I pretty much hate the DZ - even when I've gone in there with a group and were doing more killing than being killed, it's just not fun to me. (Obviously, this is simply my opinion. There are those that really enjoy the DZ.) To me, it seems that the DZ is balanced too much in favor of those going rogue. There doesn't really seem to be any down side to going rogue. Yes, there is an increase in experience points lost if you die while rogue, but the benefits and experience gains while rogue far outweigh the costs of dying rogue. The story missions and side missions were fun enough for a while. It is definitely more fun when you're with a group of people you are familiar with and game with regularly.

The incursions weren't very well thought out, in my opinion. As a matter of fact, I haven't even downloaded any of the Season Pass expansions that I have already paid for because the game lost me after Falcon Lost. The combination of how unimaginative Falcon Lost was, with the bugs and glitches, and the lack of fun I was having in the DZ, I decided to cut my losses and let it go.

I love the idea of the Division. I bought into the back story companion, called New York Collapse (which was fantastic!), and I bought t-shirts, and a coffee mug from the official Ubisoft store. I love the fact that they are going to make a movie about it. It's just the execution of the game was really poor. I honestly wouldn't recommend anyone spend money on the game - certainly not the Collector's Edition.

Gaijin's previous flight combat entry, IL2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey was an engaging, fun, harrowing air combat experience that could be adjusted to suit the player's taste.  No such luck here.

While the game strives for realism, it straddles the line of believability.  On one hand, you have pretty cool effects, like the turret camera views that show enhanced zooms and thermal imaging views, and some good sound.  On the other, you have subpar graphics, mediocre explosions, and absolutely horrible voice acting that attempts to cram in as many ethnicities at once, and in doing so, actually does them injustice (in the first two missions alone, you're introduced to an Irish guy, a Chinese guy, a cockney guy and a British chick.)  Frankly, I didn't get it.

All of that I can handle.  What killed it for me was, plain and simple, the controls.  This threw me off the most...again, in IL2, you are made to go through the paces of flying an airplane, gradually introducing all aspects of air combat until you're comfortable.  Controls could be adjusted to suit anyone, from arcade jockeys to aces.  No such luck here.  Considering that a helicopter is far more advanced to fly than an airplane, I settled in for what I hoped to be a long training excersise, and instead got a ten-minute crash course, almost literally.

The game eschews all previous helicopter-style control schemes from all previous games that ever had helicopters in it in favor of one rigid, almost inflexible setting.  Anyone who expected the thrilling zoom-and-boom of Mercenaries or any other arcade-style flight scheme had better look elsewhere.  The question is, why?  Why would Gaijin give all of their other air combat games simpler control schemes except for this one, one that needed it the most?

I'm no stranger to air combat games, but within an hour, this game had me frustrated...and bored.  The graphics have taken a serious step down on this one, and it shows.

I realize that lots of people like this game, and I can see why.  I just can't believe that this was even close to Gaijin's best effort.  I know, because I've seen it...and it didn't look, or play, anything like this.",Simply not fun...,1303516800,4,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Now, ff to present day. The price has dropped significantly, so I finally gave it a spin. Overall- I have to agree with the lukewarmers. Overall it's an okay game. Very similar to GTA, but less graphic. Sure the language is R-rated, but it seems a bit contrived. The violence seems very tame. The gameplay is repetitive, and not altogether that fun.

When the item arrived it came in nicely designed package and the actual controller looked great, unfortunately from there I had nothing but problems.
As I held the controller in my hands, the weight was nice but the buttons immediately felt stiff. It's been a long time since I held a Genesis controller but my muscle memory just knew the buttons required more pressure than the OEM Sega controller. This is especially true of the A, B, & C buttons as the top row always had a little extra stiffness on even original controllers. This wasn't ideal but it wasn't a deal breaker either.
When I tried to plug the controller in, it wouldn't go into the port. I tried gently attempting different angles (for fear of breaking the pins on my console) but there was one or more pins not allowing it to go in; I tried the 2nd control port and had the same problem and later tested both ports on another system with no luck. A careful inspection of the connector leads me to believe that one particular connector (the top left pin if looking at the holes on the connector) is defective. Most people who reviewed this item didn't have my problem so I assume the it's not incredibly common. I also want to add that that there are far less reliable brands than Hyperkin.
I would have just exchanged the defective controller for another until I learned of a far superior alternative. The website of a major national US video game retailer has original Sega 6 button controllers that have been meticulously restored to superb condition for almost the same price being asked here and they also have the 3 button model for half less than the 6 button (the retailer will remain unnamed, but if your interested why not stop by their game site). Amazon also sells the original Sega controllers but the listing are from 3rd party sellers who, based on the reviews, are often trying to pass off 3rd party controllers.

I kept putting it off time and again because I had been warned that the game was overrated and extremely repetitive by some friends. To a large extent they were spot-on correct. Had I written a review for Assassin's Creed in the first 2 or 3 hours that I played it I would've given the game 5-stars. Now after beating the game, I'm genuinely glad it's over and feel that at best it's a 2-star game.

First, the plot of AC isn't at all what I was expecting. The game is actually set in the near future not during the Crusades. Although you'll be spending most of your time in the year 1191. Confused? Yep, well the story will start to make more sense as you play along. Suffice to say that a shadowy group in the year 2012 has kidnapped Desmond - your character - and holding him hostage. Desmond is then forced to use a machine called the ""Animus"" to relive memories of his Assassin ancestors that are somehow imprinted on his DNA. It's far fetched but interesting.

Your enter your first memory as Altair - an arrogant and reckless Assassin - on a mission to recover an artifact from the Crusaders. The first mission goes terribly wrong and Altair is to blame. The leader of the Assassins, Al Mualim strips Altair of his rank and prestige and sets Altair about regaining his lost honor. Al Mualim gives Altair the task of killing 9 individuals in order to set things right. With that you're released to explore the world around you and kill your first mark in Damascus.

The world consists of 4 cities - Maysaf, Damascus, Jerusalem and Acre. Maysaf serves as the Assassin's hub and the other 3 cities are where you'll find your marks. Each city consists of 3 zones - Wealthy, Middle Class and Poor districts. At first only one zone in each city is available; as the story progresses more zones open up.

This is where the first problems really creep in. As soon as you arrive in Damascus to find your first mark you'll be locked into a very rigid mission structure. Regardless of how open the game claims to be it is actually the exact opposite. You first arrive outside the city gates, sneak into the city via some scholarly assistance and find yourself again confined to whatever zone you're in. The next task is to find a tower to climb in order to ""sync"" your map. Essentially you climb towers to reveal the locations of important story-related activities.

Each zone has a predetermined amount of towers to climb. That reveals citizens who need assistance from thugs, eavesdropping events, pickpocketing locations and other assassins that either need help or are testing you. At first this seems rather rewarding and somewhat addicting. Saving citizens from thugs garners you support of mobs that you can use to avoid city guards. Eavesdropping on certain conversations grants you a key piece of information about your target. So an and so forth. The objective is to reveal as much of the map as possible, collect pertinent information on your mark and report back to the local Assassin's office to prepare for the assassination.

While this is initially rewarding, the fact that you have to repeat the exact same actions again and again - 9 times total by games end - will leave you groaning in boredom and tediousness. After dutifully climbing each tower, saving each citizen and completing every other tedious task set forth for about 3 marks I'd had enough. You'll quickly realize that most, if not all of the tasks aren't essential to complete the mission. You can completely ignore the citizens in peril, find 3 pickpocketing or eavesdropping events which garner you the required 3 key pieces of information and then simply report to the Assassin's office in whatever city you're visiting. Then it's just a matter of tracking down your mark, killing him and then losing your pursuers. It's really that simple. Though by games end you'll likely be numb from the tedium.

Combat too starts out interestingly enough but soon becomes all to repetitive. Altair gains more abilities and improved weapons as the game goes on. At some point you gain the ability to counter enemy attacks and this is where the game really becomes simple. In essence just tapping a button at the correct moment is all you need in order to defeat every enemy in the game.

The scale and the graphics of Assassin's Creed are clearly the standout. I played through the game a full year after it was released and it is still impressive. The cities are genuinely beautifully rendered, although the luster will most certainly fade once you realize just how similar each city really is.

Assassin's Creed is definitely worth playing. Though I can't honestly recommend anyone purchase the game. Without the useless fetch quests what's left can easily be completed in a few hours. Stick with a rental.",Fun at First...,1242000000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I was really looking forward to this workout but I found it kind of dull. It had great potential and I bought it excited for the kickboxing & inline skating. The main problem with this workout is that the makers thought it would be less dull if you only did about 1-2 minutes of each exercise before moving on to the next one. So instead of say; playing tennis, you hit 10 balls in a row then it stops and moves on to the next thing. Which is probably squats. This takes all of the ""have fun while you exercise"" that the Wii is known for out of this program. Even the ""dancing"" segments are dull. Perhaps if the transitions were fast from activity to activity the concept would have worked but unfortunately, they are painfully slow. And the trainer is so slow I found myself wondering if they made this for people who did not speak English as their first language. The slow pace and slow transitions made me not really even break a sweat. I'm not entirely sorry I bought it because the kickboxing & inline skating segments will give me a little variety from time to time (but remember each only runs for a few minutes instead of being a fun game-like activity). The ability to choose the order of workouts and put them into a program is novel and would have been great if the activities were more fun.

- the setting graphics are way too dark. In a cave or in the jungle, when it rains and its cloudy, its just too dark for my liking. What really gave it a negative on the graphics was when King Kong is seen for the first time. That moment when he is coming from the deep jungle to take Anne ... I was exhilirated to see what this scene will look like ... it was terrible! I was hoping to get a little scare out of it or some dazzle at this remarkable beast. But no, he started off as a black fuzzy picture and when he came into being, the graphics being dark as well made him look like a mess. It looked like somebody scribbled mascara on the screen.

- I had to start the game over from the beginning on TWO occassions. Its bad enough when its one, but this was TWO. The first time is when I saved it on a level and played it the next day, one of the characters wouldnt move. I was suppose to follow him to a door so he can help open it cause you needed 2 people to open it. So I tried restarting the level, it wouldnt let me it just put me where I saved it and I tried playing the level before and continuing but after I beat that level and came to this level, still the same. So I had to start all the way at the beginning again. I wasn't too far into the game though. Well on the second occassion I got twice as far. I didn't manually save it, I figured it would have been auto-saved to that level but THERE IS NO AUTO-SAVE! So Im like omg, what happened to my game? So now im just like, I want to finish this game and never play it again. Which brings me to my next negative ...

- I beat this game in one night! It took about 5 hours. I had just got done beating Tomb Raider and Halo 2. Halo 2 took the longest time I loved that so much. Great game. But wow it turns out this game plays for 5 hours and has no replay value whatsoever. My next negative ...

- all the characters say the same thing when you click on them, its so dumb. All you will hear Jack Driscoll ask Carl is ""Hey Carl you hanging in there"". It would be nice if Carl told me where I had to go cause sometimes I didn't know what to do, or if he could give me a clue. But nothing, why even have that feature if you cant communicate?

- the ""puzzles"" are really easy. I wouldnt even call them puzzles. Honestly, it doesnt even have puzzles. Tomb Raider: Legends, THAT had lots of puzzles, that was an awesome game. I loved Halo 2 to death and when I played Tomb Raider, I liked Tomb Raider more than Halo because of the puzzles and because shes so hot and serene. I loved that game. And thats where we really stand between ratings. I don't see how someone can give this game 4 stars. When theres Halo and Tomb Raider. Halo is 5 star FPS and Tomb Raider is 5 star Puzzle. I would rate Call of Duty 4 star FPS but King Kong comes far short of those games. But this game is $15 so why not have it in your collection. One more negative ...

- the entire game revolves around this ... kill the monsters, find fire and a door lever. THATS IT! Honest to god, thats all you're doing on every level the ENTIRE game is finding fire to burn the bushes and a door lever to open a door. Now you can see why I wanted to beat this game to get it over with! And is why I gave this game 2 stars overall. But it got 3 stars for fun because of some positives ...

+ you're treking through a jungle and caves with dinosaurs and big creatures. It was a pretty adventurous setting I felt.

+ I like the spears and bones as weapons. Being able to throw spears at a creature then being able to take that spear and use it again is cool. After a couple times though, the spear will break. I liked throwing my spears at creatures rather than using a gun. It makes it more challenging. If you run out of ammo in your gun though, it sucks lol. But that makes it challenging too is using the spears and bones you find along the way as your only weapon until you find a crate with a gun in it.

+ you play as Kong (who needs no gun or spears =)

Overall, $15 for this game definately and I recommend buying it. You can live without it though. Soon you'll beat it and probly not play it again cause all you do is search for fire and a door lever. Even though I gave it a 2 star review, it deserves 2.5 just cause its King Kong. There should have been more imagination behind it though.

I started playing again from the middle of the Vale, and finally got out of there. I then went to a temple which was alright. After that I realized that I was going to another dungeon type cave. This time, I read a strategy guide to find out that it was about 5 levels of fighting. That's not fun. That is not fun at all. I could respect a short game with few battles, but when I fight battles every other minute just to drag out something... It almost seems meaningless after a while.
Anyways, I stopped playing there and decided to remake my party earlier today. I am enjoying it more, mostly because I know to make really powerful fighters and forget about druids. My druid last game killed about 15 units. My main character killed about 300. This can only tell you that my druid was bad. Fortunately I was able to change him later in the game. Although when I did, I got stuck with a level 1 character who was easily killed off. So yea, don't think because you can change your party means you will be changing later in the game. The feature is useless because by the time you discover just how bad your fighter is, the game will be too hard for you to change.
The game does a great job in voice actors though. The fact that I create my entire party is fine. The graphics could use some work. I get tired and bored of the same old dark environments every other minute. Even the snow seems depressing. Other than that, the game offers repetitive battles and little more. Online play isn't fun at all considering on gamespy there are usually one or 2 games going. Once you do get in the game you will learn that everyone exported characters who fought enemies on easy and had the option ""max hp on level up"" set.
Here's some advice, go play baldurs gate. My sis, sister is playing it again. She is enjoying it. This game is bland, depressing, and repetitive. Sorry but don't get it unless you wanna blow 5 bucks.","A great attempt, but....",1070668800,3,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

2.0,False,"04 17, 2009",A2AUO62GFRZI2N,B001AWBYRA,Mykl,"What makes a Call of Duty game a Call of Duty game?  Needless to say, those of us who are fans of the series do not expect Ghost Recon or Rainbow Six, we understand that this is not a hardcore tactical shooter.  What makes these games what they are is the experience.  The frantic fast paced action, the feeling that you're apart of something greater than yourself, and the many memorable moments.  Past games gave us experiences like D-Day, the assault on the guns at Cherbourg, the Point Du Hoc ""beach"" landing, the start of a Russian campaign with a rifle and no ammo and a superior officer shooting everybody not moving forward, being thrown into the back of a car and assassinated, the big bang at ending of the Marines campaign in CoD4, the AC-130 mission....  etc. etc. etc.

These are the memorable moments that make the Call of Duty series what it is.  This is why I keep coming back.  To be fair, I can tell that WaW tried, but every attempt seemed to come off as a little weak.  At the end of the game I didn't think ""holy crap, that was incredible.""  I thought ""this wouldn't have been bad if it didn't have Call of Duty on the label and I didn't already expect a high level of quality.""

To me the graphics seemed to be quite good.  I loaded up Modern Warfare to compare, and it seems as though WaW edges it out, even if just marginally.  The sound in this game is a little...  odd.  Some of the weapons sound fantastic, while some of them sound fairly weak in comparison.  Now, if this is actually how these weapons are supposed to sound, then kudos to the developers for sticking to their guns (pun intended).  Then there's the few historical inaccuracies, like the Tiger 2 tanks being where/when they're not supposed to be, and the German four engine bombers.

Then there's the odd bugs and glitches.  I actually had to download over a gig worth of patches for this game, and it's still buggy.  Obviously I can run the game, but I have to wait a couple of minutes for the mission load while WaW is listed as ""Not Responding"" in my task manager.  This makes me wonder how many slightly less patient people gave up completely when the mouse freezes and the screen goes black for minutes at a time.  This is basic ""your computer crashed"" behavior, after all.

As far as positives go, there is one that I can think of.  My #1 complaint with Modern Warfare was the blatantly obvious infinite respawns.  While this game has that, to me it seemed slightly less obvious.  Modern Warfare was so silly about this that after you've played through it once, you know the spots where you just have to run forward and get to a certain point and let your squadmates do all the killing while you hide.

The only reason I can think of to actually buy this game is to remind yourself how good the other Call of Duty games are.  Compared to other games I could purchase this one just doesn't seem to be worth the money.  Fortunately, I didn't have to pay for my copy, a coworker purchased two SLI setups (for him and his wife) so he gave me one.

In summary, I don't feel that this game has lived up to the standards of quality that everyone expects from a Call of Duty title.  On it's own it's a mediocre, although not entirely bad, arcade style shooter.  The entire experience felt very generic and mostly unexciting.","All of the bad, but where's the good?",1239926400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I was so excited for this game.  I got it as part of a ps4 bundle. I can't tell you how often I longingly looked at it in a store, only to say 'I will get it soon, there will be  a promotion, be patient as you save up for your ps4' [it also led me to conclude that this is the game that will never go on sale.  ever.] [which i finally just went all in on just to get bloodborne lol]
  I am so underwhelmed and disappointed. I thought after the opening movie, 'this will be great!'

oh, how wrong I was.

 Everyone said I should play it, that it would be awesome.  Maybe that impacted my expectations.  I felt like I was playing the walking dead meets uncharted.
So here are my complaints:
1. Not realistic.  Everyone said it would be.  Sure, you can die easily--that's realistic.  But enemies never run out of bullets.  Never.
And you can't hold much [but you can hold an inexhaustible supply of collectibles.]
2. Joel has a magic super mutant hearing ability that lets him see around corners.  and through space and time.
3. The relationship between joel and the little girl is predictable and boring.  Maybe it's because i play so much silent hill.  I wanted something different.  and if you've watched the walking dead i swear some of this stuff was copied. why not be UNpredictable and have him be a guy trying to like survive.  or a weak guy.  or something a little bit more imperfect and human with more growth.  maybe he could actually be a screw up, making bad choices left and right.  or something more interesting.  not rambo.
4. battle system is straight forward and incredibly boring.  just shoot, run, or sneak up on someone.  oh, and joel has super strength he can bash anyone's head against a wall
5. I really did not [again] want to see a bad game like uncharted reborn in a new form
Why I didn't give it one star:
1. It was nice to see a female character that wasn't overly sexualized. no loli [bc of her age] no weirdness.  it was nice.
2. Nice graphics--but at this point [and let's be honest] lots of games have good graphics and i kinda wonder if its just to make up for lack of creativity and plot these days i play my DS more than I play my consoles these days

I really find it strange that people say that I am being too hard on this game.  They say things like 'yea, you make some points but it's still good' but think about it!  The amount of time you invest, for nothing really interesting or original.  Yea, and I agree, it is hard to find a good original game these days but maybe if we stopped settling developers would actually make good games [and not lobby IGN with lots of $$ and other places to beef up reviews because people, this is NOT the best game to come out there].

But no one will probably read this.  But if you play it and you like it, that's great.  I am just angry that my expectations were not met. At all.

2.0,False,"05 5, 2008",A1YP5OVRYFD4W9,B000XJNTNS,Johnny,"I have owned every Mario Kart game, and consider myself to be a bit of an addict, spending embarrassing amounts of time practicing things such as power sliding on straight aways and downing suckaz with simple items such as banana peels.  So needless to say, I was very excited for a mario kart game that would allow me to showcase my skills online, and relive memories with old multiplayer comrades who have since moved to other parts of the country.

Imagine my surprise when I put the disc in and discovered that there was no multiplayer grand prix mode!  Working in tandem to unlock new classes, tracks, carts, and racers had always been one of my favorite parts of Mario Kart, and it was something that Double Dash did to perfection, allowing up to four people to get in on the challenge.

I had invited the friend whom I played through all of the double dash grand prixs with over to do it again on the Wii, so after we found this out it sort of killed the buzz... but whatever, we had always spent a lot more time on battles than grand prixs anyway.

We found surprise again when we couldn't do a free for all battle!  After messing around with some vs. races on motorcycles we decided to ditch this game, and spent the night on the SNES, and playing bob-omb blast on double dash.

The bulk of my issues with this game can be condensed to three items:

-Lack of options
-Lack of skill
-Lack of creativity

Double Dash was filled with options, you could combine characters in various ways to get certain unique items or racer attributes. You could choose the number of laps in vs. races, and take your choice of three unique battle styles.  In Mario Kart Wii the lack of options is mind numbing quite honestly.  It makes the game feel as though it was rushed to production.  Why can't I choose how many computer characters participate in a battle or vs. race?  Why isn't multi-player GP available?  Why are there only two battle modes, one of which is hell of lame?  Perhaps most annoying of all... WHY CAN'T I CHOOSE TO TURN THE STUPID RACER NAME TAGS THAT SUBMERGE HALF THE SCREEN OFF WHEN I PLAY ONLINE!?!?!

The lack of skill required in this game was evident from my first GP race.  Every other Mario Kart game did a good job of making item boxes scarce, and the occurence of items such as blue shells and lightning very infrequent (although there was an OPTION in double dash to change this).  There are several tracks on the Wii version that are nearly unplayable because of the volume of items.  With 12 players, and the stupid items like the thwomp and lightning cloud that don't really help anyone... it just isn't racing anymore when there is absolutely no value to your place in the first 90% of the race.  Coming back with items is one of the great joys of mario kart, I understand that (I still have fond memories of hitting the super ramp on Mario Circuit 2 with a mushroom to cut a corner and jump up two places to secure first over ten years ago), but there is something else going on entirely in tracks like the Luigi Circuit on the Wii (which might be one of the worst mario kart tracks ever), where every racer gets ripped to shreds on every lap because of the overwhelming volume of items.

This gripe could easily branch into things like how the power slide boost, for the first time ever, is not controlled by the player (and I'm not talking about the manual vs. auto drift), but simply by the length of time you hold the slide, and how they reverted to the ""hold and wait"" technique of blocking items that existed in Mario Kart 64, as opposed to timing a reverse release to block such as in Double Dash, and how the ""get a boost when you are right behind someone for awhile"" time has been cut down to almost nothing... but I think I have said enough on this.

The tracks and items in general though... where is the creativity?  I'm not expecting the wildly refreshing array of tracks we were greeted with in Mario Kart for the GBA, or the slew of new items that required poise and tact to make decent use of that showed up in Double Dash, but there is nothing new on the Wii version.  Let me re-phrase that; there are a couple of new things, but they are quickly beaten to death via recycling (soooooooooooo many figure 8's), or in cases such as the mega mushroom, little more than repeats of other items (in this case, the star).  The half pipe thing is new... but I don't really see the purpose when it is faster to not go up the ramp?  And the motorcycles... who cares/if the drift controls were the same as in double dash no one would choose them for the cheap wheelie boost?

Then there are the lazy re-hashes of the classic tracks.  Changing the placement of item boxes, and other key features of the tracks (such as making the walls solid in the ghost valley track, and removing the rock throwing natives on the N64 DK track)... I just don't see the point.  I mean, I know that most people probably don't have every Nintendo console (sans Virtual Boy) within 5 feet of eachother in their entertainment room so playing Ghost Valley 2 on SNES isn't really an option... but seriously.  Some of these re-hashed classic tracks aren't even worth playing in the form they are presented here.

There are a few nice features.  Toad's Factory, Grumble Volcano, and Koopa Cape are amazing tracks.  There are a lot of karts to choose from (although the differences, as I can tell so far, seem to be negligible... unlike the kart selection in Double Dash where the differences were quite obvious).  And it's not like the game is unplayable, quite the contrary, it can even be enjoyable for short periods of time. As part of the Mario Kart franchise though, I just expect more.

I honestly don't know why though, as every big franchise title aside from Mario Galaxy and Twilight Princess has been like this.  No options, dumbed down game play, terrible online game options and matching features, basically just leaving a ton of potential on the table and all of my expectations largely unfulfilled.

This is easily the worst Mario Kart game, and definitely the last Wii game I pre-order.

Oh, and the Wii Wheel... don't buy extras of these.  They aren't worth the hassle.  After struggling with getting my kart to power slide correctly through two grand prixs I dug out the cube controllers (ps - why is there no option to configure buttons how I want? Or... better question, why does the GCN controller layout not match that of GCN Mario Kart when the only new feature is wheelies, which could easily be added onto the unused c-stick or d-pad or... even better, onto the L trigger that items are incorrectly assigned to!?)",A ruined classic,1209945600,90,,

I love the Burnout games and had played every single Need for Speed game since the very first release. I was sure that the Need for Speed franchise could bring in the smooth realistic handling and car upgrades while the Burnout series would add in the spectacular crashes.

Well what had really happened was the the handling of the cars stayed floaty and arcadish beyond all reason with all cars feeling and sounding very much the same and the crashes from burnout are few and far between due to how the mechanics of crashing a car were implemented.

First, you cannot ram your opponents off the road like you could in burnout. So as a speeder you can ram cops but that's it. Worse yet cars now have a health bar, so in a bizzare fashion it is possible to ram a car in the rear over and over until the HP is exhausted and the car flips for no reason. Annoyingly enough this is what you often have to resort to because PITing a car is exceptionally hard due to how arcadish the cars feel. Ramming a car perfectly in the rear wheel and pushing it simply causes is to slide into a light drift instead of losing traction like it's supposed to. Being able to PIT cars is something that worked great in the original NFS, hell it even works every single GTA game and even in APB with all of it's physics issues. No piting a car in NFS though - no, here you have to use the road blocks etc. To me personally, the road blocks, spike strips etc actually distract from the thrill of driving - well had there been one in the first place anyway. Oh and before I forget, spike strips, road blocks etc, are nerfed to uselessness compared to most wanted. In most wanted hiting spike strips meant game over, here it means you spin out - whoop dee doo.

Many people felt whatever they got their hands on was surely going to win game of the year, or at least receives high accolades. As a fan of their games I would have agreed, until I got this game and played through it.

First off I'm going to say that the whole flashlight thing didn't bother me as much as it did others. And various other niggles that other people screamed bloddy murder over, I was willing to look past. But there were other things that were quite frankly unforgivable.

To be honest, this game was a good deal of fun for the first few parts. The graphics were unbelievable, the atmosphere was great, and the story was actually not bad. I figured the game could only get better; I was wrong.

The biggest problem is that all of the game's pros eventually turn into massive cons. The graphics are great, but what good are they when all you see are narrow corridors? What good is the atmosphere when you are in constant darkness? (I actually had to pump up my monitor brightness because I could never see what was going on) The story was the same thing over and over: finding PDA's and opening a door. That's the kind of puzzle system that Wolfenstein 3D operated on over 10 years ago, but I had prayed would be phased out completely by now. It's really a shame because there's some areas of the game that are truly breathtaking. The scenes on the terrain of Mars took my breath away, but these were few and far between. Why didn't id games use more open surfaces? Many fans have clamoured the same thing.

I can sum this game up in two words: boring, predictable. You walk into a room. You kill everything in sight. You pick up a PDA. A monster spawns behind you, and you kill it. Another few spawn, and you kill them. You move into the next room. Lather, Rinse, Repeat. The problem is compounded by the narrow hallways. It's next to impossible to use the BFG or the rocket launcher because you're likely to do more damage to yourself than the enemy.

The multiplayer isn't even worth mentioning. Remember, id games are the ones who realized that multiplayer was the way of the future, and designed Quake 3 Arena (one of the best MP games of all time) with this in mind. They were mimicked by the Unreal Tournament and Battlefield series. And then they come out with this, which scarcely has any worthwhile multiplayer component. Why do this? I simply don't understand it. id games literally snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.

I'm sorry, but I simply cannot find any real reason to purchase this game. I wasted my money on it, but hoped that the mod community would make up for id's lazy multiplayer component, but that never happened. If I could go back I would have definitely returned the game.

My problem is I was shipped a defective product, the right pad does not function properly. When I go into the steam controller test menu and hold my thumbs to the pads the following happens: The left pad has a green circle that appears and if I hold my thumb still, it does not move as it should and that's great! However the right pad when I hold my thumb still on it the green dot flickers and shakes, it does this across the whole pad.

The feedback is also broken between the pads, the right and left feel so weird.

Overall this controller would be nice if it functioned properly save for a few features: one you cannot map more than one set of of mode shifting to one set of buttons. For example if you want to play an mmo and you use one of the pads for skills, you will only get a set limited amount of functions (four buttons), then mode shift for four more buttons when you could mode shift more but this is not a thing.

Also the worst feature of all time, you cannot press and give an action on the pads of the controller while also pressing the control stick. For example you want to run your character forward while casting a spell, you press forward on the control stick, then press one of the directions on one of the pads to use a skill, this does not work! Instead you have to stop pressing the control stick, then press the pads, then start pressing the control stick again. This is discussing.

After having lived with this for a while I have to downgrade my original review dramatically.  What I said below is still true, but there are things that have plagued my gameplay from the beginning and are just too great a problem for me to do what I want.

1. Most and foremost is character development.  I have never got around the issue of how advancement works.  Because of the way abilities and skills are linked, how you create a character makes no sense.  The game's basic design is one which almost requires you to create a ""balanced"" character in order to achieve a ""fully developed"" character.  This just makes little sense to me, and I guess never will.  I can't say that it is a bad character development design, only that I can't figure out why it was necessary.  For example, if you want to be a magic wielder it would make sense that you max out your magic abilities.  But not so in this game.  To do this would be to create a character that will get trampled later in the game wholesale.  You would think that developing any skill would be a good thing.  But the way character upgrade works in this game it is actually bad because you cannot develop too much at one time or you miss opportunity to advance.  This is just way too frustrating for me.

2. Spell casting is still hard to control.  I would prefer right mouse click but I am stuck with a key choice (default is C).  So it is hard to get used to this given other games that let me do spells via mouse.  It has remained very difficult to cast.  Additionally spells are not seeking which means they almost never hit an enemy that moves which makes many spells useless most of the time.

3. Still don't like the fact that I cannot summon more than one creature at a time.

So from a perspective gain from long term, I am downgrading two points.

Hail Flavius!

This game has a lot to recommend it, but at the same time is troubling is several ways, most notably, figuring out how to play it.

Pros:

Long.  If you like long, then there is lots here for you.

Continues the saga.  If you are a fan of the series then this is more of what you know and want.

** Spell Creation.  Maybe the most exciting thing for me in this game is the ability to create spells.  Though not without its flaws (how do you delete a spell from your inventory if you don't want it anymore?), creation of spells is for me where this game really has the potential to shine.  If you are creative and understand the game's mechanics, you can do great stuff.  There is even a web page of ""Useful Spells"" where other players have given examples that show things like: how to get your horse to walk on water, and how to travel twice as fast, and jump twice as high, and how to create combos that destroy whole rooms of creatures.  But... to make this work you have to actually understand how the spells work behind the scenes and there is no guide for this I can find.

Cons:

** the first and biggest issue I have with the game is knowledge.  There is no real guide that describes how stuff works.  For example, how would you know that paralyze causes the target to fall over even if the spell is for only 1 second.  You don't see this as any kind of help info so you can't research it in the game to find out, yet many awesome spells take advantage of spell effects that occur even when the spell is created as a 1 second spell.  Thus the novice will never be able to create great spell combos and misses out on this most awesome and distinguishing feature of the game.

No area of effect spells?  Well, not really true.  Most spells can I guess be created with any area of effect you want.  But as a novice player I could not figure out how area of effect works.  It is not obvious that there is anything like area of effect spells in the game that I have so far found.  For example, where is your typical ""Meteor Storm"" spell or ""Noxious Gas"" spell?  Other games have such spells and the visual seen when you cast the spell in those games makes it clear there is an area of effect involved.  Not so in Oblivion 4.  Until last night I never knew there was anything like area of effect for a spell.

Leveling Up is Confusing.  Leveling up is reasonably straight forward is some ways.  But as you read about the game online to try and improve your gameplay, you are confronted with the realization that you have to choose between playing the game for fun, of spending lots of time trying to perfect your level ups to gain best advantage.  For an example, read up on ""EFFICIENT LEVELING"" in Oblivion 4.  And this leads to my final con.

Feel like I am missing out.  The ""Efficient Leveling"" concept highlights my biggest gripe, that I fell like no matter what I do, I have created a flawed character.  This in turn takes a lot of the fun out of it for me.  Now this may be my own issue in fairness, there are many things the game does to overcome this.  The magnitude of the game overall is one great example.  This game offers so many quests that you can't possibly do them all.  This is great, as long as you can get past the fact that you will not be able to do all quests and thus will miss many.  Same is true for character creation, lots of options but pick a bad combination and you have no hope of creating a high level character without flaws.  Of course, the other side of this issue is that it is often the most flawed character types that are the most fun to play in many games but I don't see that yet in this game.

Can't summon multiple creatures.  Gee, I spent all that time getting my magicka up so that I could summon and now get only one creature at a time???

Final thoughts:

Overall it is a great game.  And I suppose every negative I have has two sides.  You can play the game as a novice and have fun, or you can play as an expert and really tweak the crap out of it with your character if you know how.  In this respect I guess the game is great because it is one of the few games where both old players and new players can enjoy it in different ways thus it accomplishes something that few games do which is give new players a fun game and give old players of the series more material to work with.

But I have to say, the lack of an online or downloadable guide that has the detail needed to truly exploit the game's features is a real minus for me.  This game is so deep in certain ways that you almost need to be schooled in it before you play it.  I heard that some Colleges and Universities were offering classes in how to play certain computer games.  Wonder if there is one for Oblivion 4?

2.0,False,"06 6, 2012",A1KYZ36LVN6FZZ,B00178630A,Nicolas Green,"What is a Grailer, you ask?  A Grailer is a person who plays specifically to hunt unique items (the 'Holy Grails' of ARPGs) - In D3 terms, that would be Legendaries, Sets, and even Magic Items with their own flavor text.  It is our goal to literally collect every-single-unique-item in a given game, and Diablo has, historically, been our Grail among Grails.

Many others have expanded on the points of always on DRM, small parties, excessive downtime, and the auction house, so I'll skip those - I'm writing from the perspective of a single-player who isn't bothered with the need to be online all the time, one who isn't bothered with pings, or downtimes, or even with the gear-check requirements of the upper difficulty levels.

The only reason I play ARPGs is to collect loot - because let's face it - gameplay mechanics in ARPGs aren't going to win any rewards.  What differentiates a good ARPG from a bad ARPG, is the reward one gets for killing thousands of identical minions with the least effort possible.  And that reward is given to us in the form of loot.  For the people out there, like myself, we differentiate good ARPGs from bad ARPGs solely based on this single mechanic.

What determines good loot?  This, is of course, going to be different from every hunter's point of view - but I can imagine it breaks down into a few simple categories.

1. There should be some 'unique' items that offer unique stats that would allow for some players to build entire character to capitalize on said items.  These stats could be anything from allowing a character to cast a spell from another class, to offering defensive abilities not found elsewhere in the game.  For example, we could have a legendary Mighty Weapon that would allow a barb to expend fury to cast Rain of Toads.  Or we could have a legendary shield that bounced back mortars, or legendary boots that applied any environmental effect you were standing in to be applied to your attacks.  This is especially important because of #2:

2. Legendary Items don't necessarily need to be the best in slot, all the time, but they should at least compete within their level range.  This is especially true for those level 60 'end-game' items in Diablo 3, because of the fact that with the paired down character stats in Diablo 3 - that 800 DPS facemelt one-handed sword you find for your Barb in Act 2 Inferno, will be just as effective for your Wizard in Act 4 Hell, or your Witch Doctor the second he hits level 60.  Once you hit level 60, it doesn't really matter what the ilvls of items are - because you are now able to use any item in the game - and that level 60 legendary you just found just isn't going to compete mathematically with 95% of the random blue drops that litter the battlefield.

3. If all else fails, and collectible items simply have unique models (which is reason enough for some collector to go after them), they should at least be relatively common. Let's say there's a shield, that doesn't offer any special modifiers, and isn't any better than the trash that rains out of monsters, but it has your banner on it - and that's what makes it a collectable - that's perfectly fine.  But the drop rates need to be modified so that we, as item hunters, get a bit more of the carrot.  In Diablo 2 terms, unique rings weren't super rare for the dedicated Grailer - and every time one dropped, your heart still might skip a beat - because this one time, you might get lucky and get that lvl 79 Wisp Projector / Stone of Jordon / relatively rare ring you've been hunting for.  Of course, 99% of the time it would be a Nagelring, but the rings were still dropping, and that little boost is all it took to keep you motivated to keep hunting.

Unfortunately, for the item hunter, the only things the collector has to look forward to are items with some unique models couple with soul-crushing drop rates.  I'm sure this will appeal to some players.  In fact, and forgive me for talking shop, I once took part in a contest of grailers to collect every ilvl of Cathan's Seals from 6 to 99.  But even in the Grailer community this is a very, very, very small minority.  And as far as D3's itemization goes, that is effectively all we have going for us at the moment.",From a Grailer's POV - Wait until they fix itemization.,1338940800,5,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

I've been playing this since beta, I have a LOT of game time logged. I have about 40 - 50 hours logged since release and I don't even know how much time I played when I was playing it in beta. To put it shortly this game is missing so much and does so few things RIGHT that all I can tell you, and anyone else... Is to simply not waste your time or money. Not when you can save it for something better, or simply play something else. One person put it well, Star Trek Online is simple, easy, throwaway entertainment and that's not what you're looking for in an MMO.

This by the way (In case you don't know) costs [...] a month.

There's two main elements to this game. You can either pilot a ship in space or you can beam down to a planet/station and play it as a 3rd person shooter.

You can customize your character, and your ship. While there's quite a bit you can do to customize your character and create a crazy unique alien there's little there to create a cute or handsome human that is unique because of the presets available you're VERY likely to see many people that look just. like. you. (Or at least very very similar and believe me, I saw it all the time).

The ship customization is merely ok. Why is this? You start out in one ship, you can customize that ship with 3 other ships from the start. You can change the saucer section, the nacelles, etc. But you don't get your next ship until you hit level 11. Which for some people might take a while which means looking at your same boring ship for quite a while and the new ship you do get doesn't look that great either. You also get a new ship every time you get a new rank. Every rank in essence is 10 levels. How many levels are there? Well I haven't gotten that far yet (And I probably will NEVER get that far since I've pretty much quit playing STO) but there's a level cap of 50 or so.

You can customize your bridge, however there's nothing to do in the bridge. You can walk around and see your crew members standing or sitting at their stations, doing nothing. You can not be in your bridge while you're fighting in space or doing anything else for that matter. Think of the bridge as a separate map... like beaming to a station or planet. You (as of right now) can only be on the bridge, you can not walk around in your ship. Only the bridge.

The missions are boring, there's nothing that really gets you interested. It's the same like all mmo's, kill x amount of enemies, collect x amount of things. Some missions have you beam down to a planet and scan objects and plants. Yup, sounds exciting doesn't it? If it does, believe me, it's not.

This game is NOT like an open universe. You can't just fly around from planet to planet. Everything's on it's own map and this is what really disappointed me about star trek online.

Everything is on it's own map. You warp to a planet, you warp to a starbase, you warp to an asteroid belt. It's on it's own map, you can't leave that map and fly to another planet or anything like that.

Well how do you travel then? You can't just have some list of planets you warp to. Well in essence, that's correct. That's all you have because you see, you fly to this place called ""Sector Space"". This sector space is a hub, it has all the planets, stations, and things like that in there that you can warp to. It's basically like a world map, just slightly bigger and interactive (You can fly your ship to destinations and ""warp"" into them). Don't take this the wrong idea, this doesn't even feel even remotely like space. There's a giant grid on the ground, and there's only a few specific places you can warp to. For instance, you can only warp to Earth's space station in the Sol System. That's the only ""Map"" in there. If you warp into Vulcan System you're just warping to ONE vulcan planet. So do NOT think of this as some giant universe like EvE. So do not get this wrong... There is literally NO exploration in this game. If you wanted to go fly to other planets and beam down to them and explore life down there or if you wanted to fly to a planet and sit in your bridge and watch those stars trail by... Not going to happen.

Speaking about warping to planets and such, everything is instanced. This game is by Cryptic and if you've played Champions Online you will know what this game is like. Simply because this, in all honesty, feels like a Star Trek mod some college kids made over a few months for Champions Online. The UI is exactly the same, the servers and how the instancing works is just like in Champions Online.

You can hire officers to be on your ship, however there's only three spots for officers to be in. There's a science officer, a tactical officer, and an engineer. Only one person can be active in each of these and they give bonuses, whether ground or air. It might be a tactical officer giving you a photon torpedo spread in space, or a science officer healing people on the ground.

If you wanted to play as a Klingon, surprise you can only play as a Klingon once you reach level 6 as a federation officer. But the Klingon side is horribly broken, I've seen bugs since beta and it just has mounds of problems.

If this is your first mmo, or the only one you've ever played was the first everquest, maybe runescape many many years ago or something like that.. Then you'll probably love this. For people who play wow, eve, or pretty much anything else. You're going to find a lot of basic things missing and it's going to leave you disappointed.

The simple fact that this game has literally has no depth.

For instance, there is no real ""crafting"" to speak of. You can't train up some skills to make items, you can't manufacture anything, there's no mining, etc.

All you do is collect mineral samples that either float in space, or just float around when you're on the ground... Then you go to someone in a station that turns those samples into an item. But the items they make aren't even that good, and aren't worth the time spent collecting the samples when you get a random drop that's 10x better. Or simply just buy something from the exchange (Auction House) from another player that's thrown his old goodies away.

The combat itself even gets very boring, after you do a few fleet fights, you'll know what I'm talking about. I've been playing this game pretty heavily since beta. At first it's fun but give it enough time and you'll really start to see how boring it truly is. It just has nothing long term to keep you playing.

PVP is also just as boring, although it is ""SLIGHTLY"" more fun when playing as Klingon because you can cloak and this leads for some more interesting encounters but ultimately that doesn't save it for long.

Space and ground combat is easy. Unless you do a mission thats 3+ levels higher than you, then it is quite difficult. You can solo all the missions assigned to you, you might die but there is absolutely no death penalty. Ok well you have to wait 10 - 15 seconds after you die to respawn... But that's it. You can die a million times but who cares. You don't lose money, nothing gets damaged, etc.

Ground combat is awful and by far one of the worst aspects of the game and will end up feeling like a chore and wishing you to get back into your internet spaceship and pew pew away. However space combat is better than ground combat, but it's still bad. You have 4 shields. Up, down, left and right. Port, starboard, aft and bow. North, south, east and west. Get it? There's no shields for above and below. If you take damage from above or below it just takes it from one of the 4 shields. You simply just have to maneuver your ship and try to keep the weak shields protected while attacking. All you need to do when you're attacking is just mash your spacebar. Yup. Playing Star Trek Online you will do a lot of spacebar mashing because it fires your weapons when you're in your ship. You could press or click 1,2,3, etc. But spacebar does that for you! Your spacebar will get quite a workout :)

That being said, there's simply so little to do in the game. If you want to play a Star Trek esque game that has you running the same boring type missions time and time again, that has no depth, no crafting, and no real pvp then you'll probably enjoy this. It's just very bland, it's like a first date that makes a good impression and then you find out that there is literally NOTHING to their personality. It's fun for the first few hours, then there's really nothing that keeps you going.

I feel sorry for the people that purchased lifetime subscriptions for [...]. I'm glad I didn't.

When you get down to it, this isn't a good shooter, and this isn't a good mmo.

Firstly, there are too many unnecessary weapons that only add confusion to the game. There are two different shotguns, some weapons that are too similar, and many vehicles have similar special moves. There is so much redundancy with respect to the arsenal.

I constantly wasted weapons in my arsenal because it was difficult to keep track of my inventory and attack an opponent at the same time. The battles are so chaotic, it was difficult to keep track of which vehicle I was shooting at. Likewise, expect to be rammed by other vehicles very often (which will throw off your aim and focus off). Chaos can be fun but it's annoying in this game.

To make matters worse, the targeting system is lackluster and less than worthless sometimes. I was constantly locking on to the wrong target or the target would switch right before I fired. This creates an endless amount of frustration because my weapons were constantly being deployed at targets that obviously couldn't be reached instead of the target that was close by and almost directly in front of me.

The story is weak for the most part, but that can be expected. The boss fights are all surprisingly tepid and annoying. The last level is awesome in theory but poor execution make for a frustrating experience. The level design throughout the story is mostly great--probably the best in the series. And the new racing levels can be fun to play--even with all the flaws.

The controls are actually a step backwards from Twisted Metal: Black (PS2). But the controls aren't bad. The vehicles feel much heavier than they did in Twisted Metal: Black, which makes ramming opponents fun. It's a double edged sword though. Being rammed constantly combined with all the flaws in the game, make the experience far more frustrating than fun.

There is so much more to cover but in the end, this Twisted Metal game doesn't deserved to be named after the original Twisted Metal. This game feels tedious, frustrating, clumsy, awkward, and ultimately unsatisfying.",Disappointing mess,1353715200,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

The combination of physical survival and societal survival really appealed to me, and thought a computer game could be potentially awesome... not this one!
When you start playing, you're given the option to choose which edition of survivor to play, but the only one available is Australian Outback. Then, you choose how long of a game you want and who you want to be. Then you begin the ""survival period."" You're supposed to hurry to pick which task you want to do, but the computer does them all so there's really no point to this at all. Instead, the point of survival period is to chat with your fellow survivors. Nevermind that the dialogue is derivative, stupid, repetitive, and sometimes downright full of non-sequiters. This is how you build alliances and get people voted off.
Unfortunately, you have no way to influence your ""allies."" One second they'll tell you Colleen has got to go, and the next second they'll vote Rudy off. You can tell them to please vote for Jenna, but they'll vote for B.B. regardless. This really limits the fun factor when you're just hoping they don't feel like voting YOU off.
Then, after a 3-minute survival period, you do a reward challenge. These will be dumb games like shooting arrows at boring targets, answering repetitive questions about the outback (which reappear way too quickly), and stupid races where you click arrows to indicate effort and then click them down once your player begins to get fatigued. This is about the level of a 1982 arcade game, if that.
Then, whoever wins gets a physical and mental boost, which makes you better in later reward challenges (yay) and more points to allocate toward other survivors. It's here that you choose who you like and dislike. Nevermind that your ratings don't have to match with someone else's at all.
After another survival period (it's at this point you'll begin to realize all of the dialogue can be whipped through in two minutes, and you're going to keep hearing ""I think I should take a breather"" for another 12 episodes) you finally vote people off. After a long, boring, and dull video sequence, you finally vote whoever you want off. Of course, chances are half of the other people will vote someone else out of the tribe. Then, you get to do it all over again. Sound like fun? No? If you're a fan of survivor, wait until it's in the bargain bin ([amt]), and if you're not a fan, avoid this game like the plague.",This is supposed to be fun?,1009670400,,,

Instead of being inventive, you need to guess what the level designer wanted you to do.  Basically go straight ahead, picking off the enemies 1 at a time is a predictable manner.  When you need to use the gravity you will know, as there is an obvious object put right in front of you.

Graphics and monsters look really great.  Keyboard controls are great.

So much potential, so much wasted.  Had to play only one session a week as it becomes extremely boring.  Inside levels look a lot alike.  You will get tired of running down the corridor, finding the one door of 12 that opens, shoot the predictable monster, open the next door, loop around above where you were, and finally out a door near where you started.  Even the outdoor scenes have boulders and cliffs placed right along the path that the level designer dictated you should go.  No attacking from a cliff, no kamikaze jumps into the enemy, no fun.

Uneventful ending.  The whole last 1/3 of the game is a waste of great graphics and playability is poor (1 star).

Steam updates nearly every time you start the game, delaying your session by a minute or two even if you aren't playing online.  The game doesn't even start loading for 15-30 seconds even if there isn't an update.  Just dumb.

On the positive side the game looks great, story line is good enough to be a RE game but the game is all over the place as to what it wants to be.  There are levels that I felt like I was playing RE and then there were other levels I felt as if I was playing Tomb Raider, or another random action game.

Considering I loved the Dreamcast version so much when they made it in 3D and I've enjoyed several of the Sonic games on my daughter's Gamecube, I was excited about this game and told my wife I wanted it for Christmas (Between Call of Duty 3 and Sonic I would buy whichever one she didn't get for me).  How can you not like Sonic?

Imagine my disappointment once I started playing this game.  Wow.  I had no idea it was going to be this bad.  The game looks great and plays fast but that's about all.  Just about everything else is wrong and Sonic Team should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such an inferior product.  Giving this game 2 stars is generous, but I won't give it one star because it is fun in short spurts and could've been so much better... so much potential gone to waste.  By far the most annoying thing about this game is all the cheap deaths from bad camera angles... you just can't see where you're going far too often and that's just unacceptable.  Combine that with the limited save opportunities where you most assuredly WILL run out of lives and the game is unnecessarily difficult.  Not even difficult in a rewarding way, like Ninja Gaiden... difficult in a cheap, frustrating way.

It was hard to do and I really didn't want to give up on this game but I ended up selling it to Gamestop not too long ago for whatever they'd give me.  Lesson learned:  check reviews before buying, which I did not, I banked on it being good.  Whoops.  That was 50 bucks my wife could've spent on something else.

As far as no load screens, well that's kind of true.  While there may be no load screens, it moves slow between shots.  In fact, it moves very slow when trying to set up your shot or select clubs.

Initially, I was excited to get an Nvidia product to stream games from my already powerful PC rig which runs on a GTX 980 Ti ($700+ GPU). According to GeForce Experience and Nvidia's customer service, I've got more than enough horsepower to stream games from my PC to the Shield. Wow, that couldn't be far from the truth. The 'GRID' service is great, however, it is only free for a LIMITED time. This reeks of Xbox Live and Playstation Network subscription fees (and it will eventually be a paid subscription model with 'tiers'). As if dropping $200+ on this streamer to work side by side with a PC armed with an Nvidia GPU that's about $700 wasn't enough! Sure Nvidia, take more of my money. Playing games on the GRID reminded me of Xbox 360 graphics quality. A lot of jaggies but an average of 60fps, which is good. The really frustrating part is the actual advertising that you can STREAM games from your existing PC. You would think that this shouldn't be a big deal, but it is. Right now, peruse Nvidia's forums and you will see a ton of people venting their frustrations on why the Nvidia Shield keeps stating their PC is 'offline'. Worst yet, Nvidia's ads say you can play games ""on the go"". It's a lot trickier than that. Nvidia's customer service stated that I should download an older version of GeForce Experience BETA to simply stream anything from my PC. Once you actually get your Shield to stream PC games from your own computer..... latency and lag start becoming more obvious (and this was at my HOME network!). My home network has over 150+ Mbps down and 20Mbps up. The only way I got this to actually work acceptably for streaming stuff from my PC to the Shield was to connect the Shield via Ethernet to the router..... which is literally a few feet from my computer! So much for streaming remotely or for running this thing in another location in my house. Look, if you're looking for a media streamer only, there are cheaper alternatives. Apple and Roku will beat this unit and it's so-so Android TV features easily.

There's a lot that this game does have going for it - the facial graphics are really outstanding.  The levels designed in the hellish alternate reality of the demon are really nightmarish.  They're a tad cliche, but well executed and I never was bored looking around in those levels.  Some of the kills (using your ""demon arm"") are strangly satisfying; although the standard ""executions"" are very poorly animated and just look plain silly.

The gameplay is very standard for a FPS.  As many reviewers have noted, there are a variety of weapons; but there's rarely any reason to use any weapon other than your dual pistols.  The AI is nothing special and will generally let you hide and recoup your health and simply stand its position and let you pick them off one at a time. Since your powers depend on darkness; much of the game is spent shooting out lights.  Annoyingly, there are very few light switches to simply turn off the lights.

The multiplayer on Xbox live lags something awful.  If you manage to spend more than a few minutes online, your patience is greater than mine.  This feature was probably tacked on last minute and adds nothing to the game's value.

The worst part of this game is the way you have to travel from level to level.  You travel between parts of town (most often) via subway.  In the subway, you cannot kill or be killed; and it's mostly there to get you from one point to another and occasionaly move the plot.  The problem is that, often, you'll complete a mission, then go back to the subway, then have to travel to another subway station, and then go to a new level - and god help you if you take the wrong subway or get off on the wrong platform.  Each time you move from level to level there's about a minute or two loading.  The point is, after you complete a mission, it can be five or ten minutes before you're back shooting stuff up.  The pacing is maddening.

-Also, your mother will tell you to get your ass off the couch and get a job, but you will keep on playing the game the whole day because your friends are online for clan wars and they need your ""help"" to capture the nodes. No sarcasm intended.

Anyway, I never played a Cod game before Cod:Ghosts so I enjoyed it when I first started. It was a 3 out of 5 at first. But after a few hours some things annoyed me which I'll get into, but it was ok for my first ps4 game. My K/D was 0.4 for the first 2 weeks, but soon enough I got used to it and brought my K/D up to 1.5. I have about 40,000 deaths, 60,000 kills after 480 hours of game play that I will never get back.

Pros:
-Any COD is always fun with friends (I hear), even if Ghosts sucks. I had fun with friends, you will too.
-Clan wars are fun, but encourages playing the game so much until your eyes feel like falling out.
-That's about it.

Cons:
-The main maps are in between okay and bad, are mostly too big, and the lighting sucks. Did I mention that  I ****ING hate the Ghille suit because it's perfect for campers who want to blend into the bad lighting in the environment?

- the DLC's suck. No Ground War, randomly assigns game modes. Can't choose what you want to play except team deathmatch. Sucks.

I don't understand why some reviewers are suddently improving their ratings for this game because of recent DLC's. I only got the DLC's for the new guns, maverick and ripper. The DLC maps are good, sure, but not great. I never played DLC because I hated not being able to pick which game modeI want to play. For example, if I choose ""objective mode"", it randomly assigns either search and rescue, domination, and another game mode which I am too lazy to remember right now because I have tried to forget this COD like a former alcoholic tries to forget his booze. New Maps don't fix Cod:Ghosts because the fault is in the gameplay  itself, not the damn maps.

-Spawns still haven't improved. Spawns still suck.

It's June 2014, 6 months after release. I can still spawn trap people. I can literally wait for them to spawn and kill them 1 second after they spawn because I know where the spawn points are. Example: When I play the Whiteout map, I can spawn trap people near the boat under the iceberg. I still spawn behind people, in front of people, etc. Yawn on Cod:Ghosts.

-Camping is HEAVEN in COD: Ghosts. Seriously, it works so well. Campers get BONERS for camping. The best players are campers with an M27- MIAR. Don't you just love it when a guy with a 5.0 K/D enters your lobby and starts camping on a certain building on a map? Think Whiteout: Camping spot on top of the roof of the house, picking people off the corners of the roof with the M27, or how about Prison Break: on top of the hills and Overlord: on top of the central hill on the right edges of the map. Just stay in these spots and you'll get a 5.0 K/D no problem too! Think of the possibilities!!!!! WHOOO!!!! F**** Yeahhh!  (ROLLS EYES).

- Bullets are STILL Inaccurate!!!!!! Quickscoping and sniper shooting is the best example of this problem. Many times I have  shot a guy with my sniper to find that my bullet did no damage. There is a glitch especially on snipers, like if you shoot a person on the edges of their body (sides of the head, shoulders, ) by quickscope, your bullet will do no damage. Annoying. All other bullets will occasionally miss their target even though your screen clearly shows you didn't miss at all. Lag compensation issues still there.

Just a bad game, don't want to write any more. I may buy the new Cod in November, but not without first reading the reviews.

2.0,False,"02 23, 2009",ARFLBNH2D159B,B00163ROMC,Carlos A. Ramos,"Deadly Creatures is an odd beast. The concept itself should turn a lot of people off, but underneath its not-so-cute exterior is a game with potential that doesn't play on that potential.

The level design is, for the most part, really interesting. It gives you the same sense of scale as does Super Mario Galaxy, only it's limited and not as grand as you would have guessed. The locations are really interesting and unique, and do great jobs of playing the game through an insects (or arachnids, for perfectionist) point of view. The environments are nice, but the texture looks a bit odd. It gives me the feeling that an alternate engine was used to produce the textures as the one used to produce everything else.

Graphics are good for a Wii game, no where near the level of Super Mario Galaxy or Metroid Prime 3 , nor does it deliver the tech achievements of something like CoDWaW, but it is good. The character models are pretty good, they look real and (when in motion) creepy. All of the legs move in unisons as you would expect a real insect to move. Using the analog stick to slowly crawl up to an enemy, while watching the hairy legs of the tarantula smoothly move, is truly a sight. Unfortunately the frame-rate takes a serious dip on seemingly random occasions. A new enemie appears, the frame-rate drops, swip the camera to a wider area, the frame-rate drops, or even use the dash ability, and the frame-rate drops.

Controls are only decent, motion kills in the scorpion levels are a bit off, so your stab/swing/etc. will be performed on screen a sec or 2 later. It doesn't ruin the game, but it deos detract from the immersion factor. Standard attacks are a combination of button presses (for weak) and motion (for strong), and generally it works well. You'll occasionally have to repeat a motion several times, but thankfully it's not too common.

The most impressive part of the game however is the atmosphere; it almost achieves a Metroid-like level of creepiness and loneliness. Any Metroid player can tell you that's a great thing. The sound is great also, bringing absolutely terrific voice acting and a great soundtrack together. The soundtrack consists of ambiance and subtle tunes, and when combined with the sometimes disgusting SFX, it really brings you into the game.

Deadly Creatures isn't perfect though. While you've probably heard this before, the game does have some bugs, or technical issues. Enemies may sometime get stick in areas, or appear underground (unintentionally of course), or your motions may not be registered, and while id wish that these were rare occurrence, it happens enough to be a bother.

Worst of all though, is that the game simply isn't that fun. The combat is repetitive; locals are interesting at first, but quickly loose their flair as you're forced to backtrack through the same areas within different levels. The story, while shallow and bare, is easily the most interesting part of the game.

I would recommend this to anyone with some spare cash (or parents cash, seeing as the game is rated-T), because your probably never going to play anything like it.  The game is short, maybe 7-9 depending on skill and ambition. After that there's nothing, and I mean nothing to do. While its hard to recommend Deadly Creatures at full price, i would definitely suggest you go out and pick it up eventually. Chances are you've never played anything like it, and if the game doesn't sell well, you may never play anything like it again. It's a bit rough around the edges, but it's definitely a memorable and unique experience.

It could be a general or a decadent noble, if someone needs to die your order calls on your services.

When you first play the game you will be blown away by both the graphics and the agility of your character. Think of him as a more realistic version of the Prince of Persia. While you won't be running alongside walls you will be doing a lot of climbing and I'd have to say 90% of everything in this game can be climbed.

During the beginning of the game Altair makes a no-no and gets demoted to a zero in the order. So all the fancy moves and weapons are gone in the beginning. You gain back abilities through the missions in the game. To gain information about your target you might eavesdrop on a conversation or ask a reliable informant who will ask you for a favor in return. After that you find your target and execute them.

Sounds very cool. Now for the problems.
First a twist in the game's storyline is revealed to the player about 5 minutes into the game. It is a twist equivalent in stupidity to M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" and will make you hate Ubisoft for ruining a perfectly good storyline.

Next, the game lacks a decent combat system. When engaging is sword-play you have block, parry, and throw and with a few well timed mouse clicks you can set up a neat ""counter-attack"" that could range from a smack across the face to a sword in the stomach. The problem is which counter attack is used is completely random. This can get annoying when you want Altair to kill someone and all he does is back hands them. Another thing to mention about combat is your character improves in ability but the guards do not. By the end city you will be able to competently defend yourself against 20 guards or more (or however many you can get on the screen) without fear of death because they attack you one at a time.

Finally the gameplay is very repetitive. Get your target, get information, find target, kill target. Altair makes life as an assassin down right boring. It's done the exact same way every time.

Often times you will find more enjoyment running around silently kill old men or guards and running around like a mad-man just for fun. Even this will get old after a few hours of play.",A great big world of nothing,1232496000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Weir,"I'm one of those guys who picks up a shooter mostly for the campaign, but I will dabble in the multiplayer for a couple dozen hours, then it's off to the next game. There's far too many great games to play without grinding out yet another level cap in yet another ""shoot things and get points to unlock upgrades"" multiplayer mode.

That out of the way, Homefront is one of those games that I really regret buying, and not renting. I knew going in that the campaign mode was short - most professional reviewers are putting it at around 6 hours. However, reviewers typically play games on easy mode to get through them so they can review the game and publish the content on whatever website or magazine. Typically I find that if a reviewer claims a game is 7-8 hours, I can add about 20-30% to that and that's how long it will take me.

In this case, I could subtract 20-30% because when all was said and done, I hadn't even clocked 5 hours in Homefront before the credits were rolling. (by the way, Homefront ends right as you actually start caring about the story and leaves you hanging with NOTHING but credits - Imagine playing your favorite shooter and then you're halfway through and your console breaks and you can't play it anymore. It's just like that). This was on normal difficulty with me deliberately trying to take the game slowly....picking my shots carefully from cover, not trying to rush through each firefight, exploring the environments when the game permitted, and searching out the ""hidden"" newspaper articles scattered throughout the levels.

I only paid about $30 bucks for this game (thanks to a gift card) and I feel ripped off. I really feel sorry for the console guys who purchased this at $60 retail. Ouch.

Visually and Aurally, nothing here is better than mediocre. The shooting mechanics in this SHOOTER game are poor, effectively making Homefront NOT FUN TO PLAY. There's little to no tactile feedback as the guns have very little recoil, and the firing sound effects, particularly when firing full auto, are underwhelming. The guns just lack ""punch"" and lack the feeling of power and heft that makes the shooting of other first person shooter games, namely BFBC2, exciting and visceral. To give the game some credit, the sniper rifles are decently done and the sniping parts of the campaign are fun.

The story is Homefront's best feature and everybody knows the story by now so I won't elaborate, but I will say this: As you fill the shoes of what is basically resistance fighter / insurgent, why not take advantage of the scenario and design your game around guerrilla tactics, setting up elaborate ambushes and using hit and run tactics, KAOS studios?  Instead you're just another dumb grunt with a machine gun, going through the same levels we've all been through before, killing thousands of enemies.  Cool story, same generic FPS. Way to miss the boat, KAOS.

I did play a couple hours worth of multiplayer. It's nothing exciting..more of the same. If you've played any of the recent CoD's and BFBC2, you'll know exactly what to expect. There's a slight twist in that you get BPs (battle points) from killing things - stop me if you've heard this one before - that you can spend on upgrades. The only difference between Homefront and other games is you can buy temporary upgrades in the middle of a match, be it a flak vest or a rocket launcher, to get you out of tight situations.  That's it.  More shooting, more starting at private and rising up to corporal, 50 bazillion sergeant ranks, lietuenant, captain, etc., more unlocking weapons that aren't actually upgrades. I'm blown away by how innovative all this is! (sarcasm). Also, you'll enjoy getting sniped and spawn camped perpetually in each and every match, at least until they start patching and working on the balance issues of what is essentially a post-launch multiplayer BETA.

The only way to get more characters on your side is to convert them. Hence, the spiritual warfare aspect of the game. You can train your converts to be pastors, missionaries, gospel singers, prayer warriors, etc. you can also have them build buildings to house more converts to training, house and feed them. This sounds like a lot of micromanaging and it is. The point and click aspect is only fun for so long. Not to mention the fact that the Ai is a little dim, and you constantly have to tell them what to do without them doing it themselves.

One nice part of the game is its mapped view of New York City. However, the streets feel constricted so you cannot move your character otherwise enormous army around very easily. Plus even though New York is mapped, there are limited varieties of the buildings. That might be okay if you could earn them, but the game only lets you get what it will let you.

The characters all look the same even after you convert them. They do change to the same outfit after awhile, but it's still a pain to tell them apart.

The game does offer online play but only to play as the peacekeeping forces. You also gain access to all their powers. Like doctors and colleges-oh I'm so scared!

The game is well crafted to be a decent RTS game without being annoying on the Christian angle. This is at least more interesting than The Bible Game. But I still give it the same score because of the poor graphics, micromanagement and repetitive, boring game play.

On a 1 to 10 scale, 10 being the best, I now rate this game at a 3. Fun yes, to much effort put into all the debris around the track, which should have been applied to the realism of the game, or better, more realistic car control.

Yet with the release date oh so far away, I decided to take advantage of the recent price drop of the Call of Duty PC game hoping that it would tide me over. However, after playing countless hours of the game on my PC, I'd have to say that Call of Duty: Finest Hour is a bit of a disappointment. I understand that a console has nowhere near the processing power of a PC, yet I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by FH's graphics which were simple and bland at best. However, I was mostly disappointed in the lack of save points throughout a level. That meant after spending ten minutes or so blasting your way through a difficult level, you would have to start the campaign all over again from start to finish if your player is killed. I always appreciate a challenge, yet not when the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against me. The one aspect that the console version did translate well was the ""war is hell"" theme. The beginning level featuring you as a Russian soldier taking back Stalingrad from the ""steeking Germans"" was intense with gunfire raining all around you and enemy soldiers around every corner.

You command a squad of soldiers with certain skills and equipment; and you get to control the leader in combat, hacking up the enemies and doing special moves...

The first few missions were fun and getting to improve the leader and the army was fun as well - but it gets old very fast.  There is very little surprise or innovation on the part of the character development or story progression.  In fact, if you've played other RPG or fantasy games you'll notice the typical formula in this one - which is not bad if you like that style.

The graphics, sound, and performance were great - but it had a modern musical score with electric guitars and hard rock.  Doesn't bother me but it does detract from the flavor of the game.

All said, the game is repetitive early on with very little in the way of excitement to offer.  Players may enjoy the action - if you like button-mashing this is full of it.  The graphics and bloodshed are great and will satisfy the action / gore fanatics out there.

The Xbox 360 wireless controllers are great, but being wireless, you are going to need a battery for them.  While are first glance it seems logical to get the battery pack built for the controller by Xbox itself, it is ultimately an unnecessary expense.  If you buy this battery pack then you also need to buy the special charging station for it.  This charging station can charge two battery packs at a time, but only the Xbox battery packs, it doesn't charge anything else.  You would be saving both time and money to instead invest in a set of normal AA rechargeable batteries and a normal battery charger which will not only charge faster, but also give you batteries that be be used in other electronic devices.

Aside from the fact that this just doesn't make sense to buy, there seems to be some quality control issues with these battery packs, especially the novelty colored ones.  Some worked great, but others held a charge poorly or drained too quickly.

In the end I would give these a hard pass and instead just use regular rechargeable batteries.","An unnecessary product easily replaced, for the better, by AA rechargeable batteries",1511049600,,{'Color:': ' Blue'},

Brave in the sense it attempted a lot of new and cool things never before seen in gaming. DR2 upped the ante and I felt was hard as hell and was hobbled by the stupid timer. I never got to meet nor defeat most of the colorful psycho characters because you were constantly needing to finish up missions that would count down some counting down all at once while feverishly trying to complete the main mission to prevent your daughter from being zombified. The world was quite expansive and quite a bit to see and do but you were too busy trying to beat the clock to enjoy crafting weapons, trying on ridiculous clothing combinations, bashing hordes of the undead or going buzzsaw to psycho without feeling rushed along. DR4...well..It is a gorgeous game for sure. Rich colors, a TON to explore and...well, no timer, no creative psychos, no awesomely ridiculously wild psycho cut scenes, no throwing your weapons at your enemies by accident or out of spite. The game is offensively short and almost to compensate for that they have stocked the pond with stupid ""challenges"" to find things like journal entries and voicemails etc. The game designers also upped the awesome factor on the types of weapons you can create. Christmas Light wrapped baseball bat? check. Tee shirt launcher that shoots explosive holiday items? check. DR3 was a terrific compromise, the threat was still real there were zombies everywhere and you started the previous DR games fairly weak and had to work your way up both with weapons and in strength and it really mattered for your gameplay which really upped the stakes and playability. DR3 slowed down that clock, introduced some cool new features including when you defeated the psychos you could collect their special weapons. The safe houses in DR3 actually felt rather unsafe until you completely cleared them out. In DR3 the safe houses are merely hubs to purchase items. blah! And the zombie threat? not so much. There are a lot of them and a lot of variations of them in this game but they don't seem to pursue you much and there is no way to change that in the game because there is not even a difficulty setting. DR4 is amateur hour as you level up ridiculously quickly, the blueprints are incredibly easy to find and, in the end, although there are a ton of different weapons you can make they are all mostly made with the same base items that can be found pretty much anywhere in the game. Did I mention the game is incredibly easy? Finally, I take issue with all the bugs. You will get a button prompt such as Y+B just as in the last game or just B (for xbox one) to finish off a zombie with a cool move but it is glitchy most of the time and does not work. there are also other glitches I noticed in this game but am not tech savvy enough to explain them in an educated manner. I just know that for the price paid they should not be there upon release. If you are just looking to blow off steam by wandering around creating awesome weapons and gorily mauling the undead this game is for you but I would still wait until it is offered for dirt cheap.

2.0,False,"05 27, 2008",A17KMHCEI7AI56,B00139U8QI,L. J. L.,"Have you ever played a game that you could swear hated you personally? That's how I feel about Rondo of Swords, a game that seems to have been designed with the expressed purpose of being as unfair as possible.

I won't go into the story because there is nothing to talk about here. There is barely a storyline and what little there is serves merely to shoe string the tactical battles together. Between each mission there is a little bit of scrolling text that tells you where your army traveled to and what new disaster befell them. Then the action switches to the battlefield where the units will chew the fat for a bit, one of the bad guys will spring up and laugh maniacally, and then they get down to the business of tactical combat.

With a story line this thin, Rondo of Swords is left to live and die by its combat system. The basic idea of the combat system is unique. Basically, units have a set number of squares they can move through. You draw a route on the touch screen for the unit to follow and any enemy character you pass through will be attacked and any unused ally character you pass through can give you some kind of status boost like healing or increased chance of hitting the target. On paper it sounds like a pretty good idea, but RoS has designed it so the system works against you.

Let us count the ways RoS fudges its game play:
1) Worthless mages- In RoS, there are two types of long range fighters: archers and mages. Archers can move around the field and then attack. Mages can only move or attack. It's either one or the other. So the choice often comes down to if the mage will attack the enemy baring down on it or flee to safety. To add to their worthlessness, mages can't take a hit and will almost always die with one attack. If you are lucky enough to get the enemy positioned so the mage can fight, magic points are so stingy that you will be lucky if you can cast more than two spells in a battle. The kicker is that, by the time I gave up at the 15th battle or so, half of my units were mages.

2)Worthless Shopping- Like most RPGs, RoS lets you buy stuff to upgrade fighters and give you an edge on the battle field. Unlike most RPGs, RoS gives you no control over what you buy. During battles, you can send unused units to pick up some stuff for you. You have no control over what the unit purchases and there is a chance the unit will loose all your money and come back empty handed. Also, some units are better at shopping than others and it seemed that the more invaluable the unit was on the battlefield, the better it was at shopping and vice versa. As a result, I rarely used the feature because the unit would come back with junk.

3) The Zone of Control- As if to make up for having units that are easy to kill and throwing tons of enemies at you, you have the route system that allows you to attack multiple enemies. But then RoS goes and turns it against you with a lovely skill called the ZoC or Zone of Control. Basically, this skill will stop a unit's charge dead in its tracks and prevent it from attacking or moving any more. You tend to face big clusters of enemies with this skill while you only have one unit that can do this, and the enemy ZoC seems to activate almost all the time while yours doesn't. This creates a situation where the enemy is free to hammer at your entire army while you struggle to wear down one of their units.

4) Unbalanced game play- I should think that most games should shoot for a kind of natural progression of difficulty. RoS has a feature were you can restart the current battle and keep all the experience earned during the aborted battle and regain all defeated units and used items. I imagine this is so you can level up units that have been inactive for a while and perfect your battlefield strategy, but what makes it so cheap is that you are practically forced to use it. On some maps, the only conceivable way to win is to basically restart the battle over and over until you have beefed up your very best fighters to have way more levels than the enemy.
And you must do this for hours sometimes. To give you an example, it took me nine hours to reach the 14th or so battle. I bought this game used and the previous owner had a game save that indicated it took him seven hours to reach the fifth battle.

This isn't to say that RoS is completely impossible. For every battle designed for maximum forehead vein popping, there is one that is actually quite nicely balanced. Challenging but a workable challenge. It's during these that you can see what a great game RoS could have been. But still, RoS is like a plate with half fillet mignon and half regurgitated cheeseburger and I wouldn't call that edible.","Rondo of Swords, Elegy of Good Game Play",1211846400,27,,

You drive around the city, do side quests, and shoot or beat up people.  The difference, this time you're the good guy so your hands are tied.  Some dumb pedestrian gets in your way, no running them down, you take a penalty.  I've even seen them literally dive into the street from the sidewalk before.  Hey though, you're a cop so you're taking care of the people.

So how do they repay you?  Well, a fair amount of the time you go into break up a fight, both people fighting will attack you.  That's probably realistic, so no big deal.  However, the loving citizens also ignore your siren, routinely crash into your police car, and at one point after maybe a couple hours playing ran me and an AI controlled cop down in the middle of the street and kept going.

Hardware wise the PS TV is small and elegant. It does not take up that much room at all and best of all Sony included an HDMI cable with it. The setup was not that hard. I had to synch my PS4 controller to it  through a USB cable. After that it was a setup screen with easy to follow prompts.

It's mostly a series of timed target and critter shooting with increasing levels of difficulty (at least as much as I've explored so far).  If you like shooters that are more cartoonish, this one is pretty decent.

The drawback, however, is the game controller attachment - the thing you connect your controller and nunchuk to so you can more easily do the actual shooting and maneuvering.  In short, it's really awful.  In order to use it properly, one must put the left hand on the back to maneuver, the right hand on the front and aim pretty much like a dweeb who has never shot any kind of firearm.  Movement is awkward while firing and firing is extremely inaccurate while moving.  The best thing to do is to try to use the controller as a pistol (although it fails at that due to the two-handed design and the front-grip on it for shooting instead of the back grip).

To list the controller's drawbacks:
1. The length is too short for a rifle-style shooter.
2. Integrating the nunchuk into the weapon was a stroke of stupidity for any kind of shooter.  As a rifle, the hand placement is backwards.  Even when shooting a pistol, if one does it two handed, the left hand is cupping the right, not six inches behind the right hand. You'll do better in the game if you leave the nunchuk unattached and use it in your free hand.
3. Stand WAY BACK from your television to get any similarity between your aim point on the screen and the place the target gets hit.  (At least 10 feet)
4. If you have the rechargeable battery pack, the Wii controller it has a real hard time fitting into the module.  Try not to force it or it will break.

2.0,False,"02 17, 2010",AVVIJ7EBPS4EI,B000VL6OWG,Dave,"First off - the graphics are amazing. The graphics engine supports visually stunning landscapes and both the player and non-player characters are crafted with loving care and attention to detail (if you buy this definitely look closely at the monsters you are fighting, the level of detail on each is impressive). Along with this you have such things as fluid cloth animation, physics for hair that moves and depending on wind and movement. What is nice is that this is a very efficient graphics engine as well, and though many people will eventually be bogged down in a large pvp battle, a recent moderate system will run this game with all settings on maximum easily. Don't look too closely though. Circles are actually octagons, the landscape looks like EverQuest from 1990. There's no such thing as ""rounded"" straight angles and lines on the landscape, everywhere. Oh, and though the armor is amazing, both in design and graphical quality, it is of a sort of anime nature, so the women aren't wearing much and the guys look like mechs. Since the Armor is actually separate models than your character and not just skins it both looks far more impressive than most games (and the pieces match, unlike the clown gear of WoW) and it also suffers from the straight line effect. Triangular breasts and square pants are in store if you don't zoom out after making your initial observations.

But graphics aren't everything, no matter how much the graphics and the customization of character and even equipment might appeal, there needs to be something else. Aion got a couple of things spot on - the skill chains are an interesting way to add some complexity to the normal one-two-three of many games. Note that depending on your class and situation this just means a one-two-two-two-three button press i.e. because of the way the skill chain works, it many times simply activates, the player clicks through, and you move on to your next skill or skill chain.

Crafting is another big point in this game - if you can gather one type of material, you can gather all similar types (i.e. metals, foods, fibers, ect. form one skill) which makes it much more interesting and easy to skill up gathering skills and to support multiple professions. Each character has the ability to master two trade skills and another to a lesser degree. The items made from this process are very useful and often times better than the items that (very rarely) drop in the game. Anyone who enjoys this aspect of games might find Aion a nice home. Also, you do gain experience from tradeskills and gathering, so while it is not a viable way to level, you don't completely give up gaining levels when you tradeskill.

So why the low rating? Because, after having played it for several weeks I can see why people in many reviews talk about a ""lack of content"". The fact of the matter is that the game space and world is fairly small. You won't notice this until you're at least level 30, but it becomes quite apparent after that. There are limited areas to quest at any level, limited places to get loot or drops, ect. The first instance you have access to is at level 25 with a 18 hour lockout time. Did I mention you'll probably leave with one to two green drops that you can sell for relatively little money? No loot unless you're really, really lucky. You can't come back here after level 28 either. While instances getter better past this point, it's nothing many players of MMOs will be used to.

Quests also practically stop after level 26, at least as a means of gaining gear or experience. By the time you complete most quests you will have better gear than the rewards and usually killing one to two mobs will equal the quest experience reward. Of course, the quests usually are simply ""kill 25 of ___"" ... and many of these quests are repeatable, over a hundred times. So you can make what people call ""grinding"" a little more rewarding, even though running back to the quest giver to turn in and reacquire the quest is probably a waste of killing/experience time. If you buy this game with the WoW game mechanic and theory in mind - you're going to be severely disappointed within your first couple of days playing.

There is no escape from pvp. And pvp in this game means being killed while doing the above mentioned grinding. If you don't mind this, it's the game for you. If you want to level up and do it to other people, buy it! But for many this will become a massive source of frustration and annoyance. When it takes you 8 hours of killing individual mobs to level up, and you have two places to do this in, when a higher level player decides you're not going to use that area, it's game over for the day. Seriously, you *will* be killed, over and over again while trying to level up. You will not even have a chance to fight back either since even if the person is you're level (which they won't be) they have come prepared to pvp, so better gear, potions, scrolls ect are at their disposal to ensure that you die and they escape.

***Parents*** If you are considering this game for a child be aware that after level 10 the player enters the one and only channel that connects the entire server together - LFG. This channel is used for chat, selling of goods, and people actually looking for groups. This chat is most times, if not always, littered with racism, sexism (extreme), graphic sexual content, vulgarity, and plenty of complaining, whining and arguing. Since this is the only channel to effectively look for a group in, you're pretty much subject to this no matter what. You will have to read it, you will be exposed to it.

The player base is really an issue, since this is an MMO it's all about the collective experience and a game that is based (aside from all that grinding) on social activity and interaction. I've found most people to be reasonable and many times interesting once you get a legion or a group, but a very large portion of the people that still actually play this game are generally speaking very self involved, unhelpful, aggressive and rude. If you've played World of Warcraft in an Alliance battleground...this is the same thing, all the time, and much, much worse.

I don't really want to say don't buy this game, because I really like a lot of the aspects of it, and I'd like to see the community grow ( and mature) so that the game can continue to develop and expand into a more finished title. At the same time, if you have a tight budget, and realize that this game means continuing to pay each month that you play it, I don't want anyone else to buy it like me, to at first think -""what are all these reviews on various websites and especially the game website about? This is great""  It's not. Period. The game is Korean made, and there will not be two versions for a North American audience with different tastes. The game has been out for a year prior to it's North America release, so anyone that says it is a new game is confused. The game has been in a released format for over a year.
Unless you really love ""ganking"" (getting killed while minding your own business by a player) ""grinding"" (standing around killing the same things over and over and over again for hours if not days) and a less than supportive or involved community of teens at each other's throats I'd highly recommend that you find a different means of occupying your time.

If your immediate response to this review, that states as clearly as I can some of the most important aspects of the game that a prospective buyer/player might have, is ""stop whinging"" ""QQ"" and whatever else you use to describe someone who is dissatisfied or unimpressed with a product, then this is the game for you.

I actually got a lot more enjoyment out of it than I was expecting.  The art style is generally charming.  The story (what I got of it) is fairly interesting.

The puzzles range from very easy, to absurdly hard, though there's a general progression of easier to harder puzzles as the game progresses.  I found many of the puzzles fun, some annoying, but solvable, and a decent chunk either no fun at all, or impossible for me to figure out.

The way the game is structured, one usually has the ability to skip puzzles that one is stuck on-but unfortunately not always.  I had to give up finally on a puzzle somewhere past the halfway mark.

On a *very* ""nit-picky"" technical note, I did find the load time between screens a bit annoying as I progressed.  It's only a couple of seconds, but it adds up.

Bottom line-if you're a fan of point and click adventures, or puzzles, you'll probably enjoy it.

I waited for about ten seconds, only to learn that the loading was simply to throw a quick THQ logo onscreen. To add to that, the loading for actual in-game play is much longer. You can actually walk to the kitchen and grab a drink, come back, and still see the loading screen. As for the gameplay, the so-called ""combo"" system is simply engaging in combat, and pressing in one of four ways on the directional pad during combat. The combat is extremely stiff, and aside from random grunts and moans, nothing special. The overworld movement is not too bad, however, with the camera keeping up fairly well with the main character. Graphically, this game is a disaster. Choppy framerates, draw-in that is downright laughable, and a graininess that would of been criticized even on the PSOne. At one point, you enter a harbor area, and see the open skies ahead of you. However, as you step forward, you see a castle form not even 500 yards ahead of you, causing a friend of mine to joke that they had a cloaking device. In terms of sound, the music is quite nice, really. The failure comes through in the aforementioned combat. With that exception, I have no real gripes about the audio. The game itself would be very well had these flaws been dealt with. The storyline is intriguing, and the characters are fairly well designed. The quests are enough to keep you occupied for some time, and varied enough to avoid boring you. The dialogue is splendid as well. Overall, Summoner is a potentially good game gone horribly bad.

When my big old box of a PS2 (one of the first to come out, mind you) up and died in November my heart was broken. But, thankfully, the PSTwo's were coming out the same day. What a great coincidence! I ran out and bought one.

Flash forward four months. Here I sit staring at the now-dead PSTwo. She will no longer play any games or DVDs, giving instead the dreaded ""The Disk Could Not Be Read"" error (modified up from the old ""Disk Read Error"" message--thanks, SONY!). Lens cleaners have failed and there's no little white wheel inside that a felt tip marker and some internet help can adjust (as was the case in the older models). Did it overheat? She gave off a nasty smell..and it's known that the PSTwos get very warm to the touch, despite being loaded up with heat sinks and yes, even a little fan that does a great job blowing the already scorching hot air on to critical parts. Was it just an unlucky, bad unit? Did it have something to do with Sony's rumored use of cheap parts? Do these new units have some inherent design flaw which results in a very short and terminal lifetime?

I don't know. You decide...just keep this in mind before you plop down a hundred and fifty bucks. The PS2 is still the best console with the best selection...buy criminey! Whatever happened to the days when you'd buy a product and it *wouldn't* fall apart after a few months??

Well with Diablo III you don't have to worry about it the game looks exactly like Diablo 2 in fact you could probably call this Diablo 2.1. Eleven years after Diablo 2 comes out and they haven't made hardly any changes that you can you tell, I'm not sure what they were thinking. Here are my observations of the game. First the biggest thing is to play single player you have to play online through Battle Net. This has to be the dumbest idea they could have come up with.  I had problems getting my account setup since I hadn't played Battle Net in about 10 years so I didn't remember my password and the other information to reset it. It took several hours to get the download and get my account straightened out. I was fortunate and didn't have any problems getting into Battle Net once I had my account setup.  I did have problems once I got on; I got kicked out of Battle Net 3 times during the game. Once after a major Boss Fight and I lost all of the treasure, which really made me mad. There is a lot of server lag where you are in a fight and one second you are toe to toe fighting it out and the next you're on the other side of the screen, so disappointing.
  The game took me about 25 hours to complete with a level 31 Barbarian. The graphics and music are pretty much the same as Diablo 2 and you still have this far away camera angle and you can't zoom in to your character. I guess it really doesn't matter since you can't really customize your character you're stuck with one of five premade character classes all with a male or female option. You would think after 11 years you would be able to customize what your character looks like hair color and style and facial hair or not, nope they made them for you and sometime they are just ugly. You would think if you play with friends you could get confused on which is your character.
  Like I said there is nothing new in the game I did notice that they removed the matched armor sets that if you got the entire set it would give you a bonus.

In the end, I am disappointed that I could not complete the storyline due to the game crashing on chapter 8, Carm Dum.

Story: 8/10

If you enjoyed the Lord of Rings movies, this storyline is a perfect spinoff.  I had no idea there was a War in the North or the key characters involved.  The story takes place at the same time as Frodos journey.  And you eventually learn that your three characters, Eradan (Ranger), Farin (Dwarf), and Andriel (Elf) play crucial roles in aiding the Fellowship of the Ring.  Just by playing through the game, I learned more back story that filled in many questions I had in Lord of the Rings triology- with a little mention of The Battle of the Five Armies.  Ever wonder why Arwen had a choice to live a mortal life? Or why the Eagles couldn't just drop Frodo at the mountain? Where were all the dwarfs in Lord of the Rings?  Im sure many of these questions are in the books, but for those that don't remember reading them the game really does fill you in on the details.  The story does not spend much time in character development like Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli but again, I was not expecting much.  The story definitely exceeds my expectations.

Gameplay: 7/10

The gameplay was lacking in areas that would be expected in AAA titles.  The game is very linear.  You cant switch between characters during a mission and don't expect too much help from the AI if you are playing solo.  After reaching the end of a section, you could review character stats and it was not uncommon to see your character totaling a million point damage while your companions barely scraped by with fifty thousand each.
Some might find this normal- I mean you don't want your companions over-powered and leaving little for you.  Your point is valid but it will quickly change when you are overrun by orcs or the mission requires teamwork.  You might find yourself yelling at the screen in a hopeless effort while your companions crawl towards you for aid.  Trying to heal them is a trap given the game mechanics.  An enemy can easily disrupt your attempt to heal a companion and you will eventual die and have to return to the last save point.  Retreating may be the only option to separate the enemies from your companions and buy you enough time to heal them before an enemy tries to attack.

I found the tutorial very sparse and learned as I played through the game.  As your character levels, you earn 3 points to place in strength, dexterity, will, and stamina- and one skill point.  If you go the Ranger/archer route, you will want to look for dexterity bonuses in armor and skill points added in arrow damage and arrow quantity.  You start out with 30 arrows and they will go by fast- no playing Legolas with infinite CGI arrows.  I originally focused on dexterity and increased arrow damage and eventually balance the Ranger with duel wielding swords.  I would also add skill points to reduce your power move cool-down time.  Your character can block (not effective all the time) and dodge roll, but when you are overwhelmed by an enemy you will rely on your power moves.  It didn't take long to find out that if you time your power move against a stronger enemys attack, you will not be pushed back or receive damage.  Basically, attack an enemy normally and when it is about to perform a powerful attack, use your power move to negate any damage.  This is why reducing the cool-down for these moves are important and critical to survive.

While most the game could be consider hack and slash, you cant just mash buttons together and expect to survive.  You need to use some tactics.  Taking out archers or mages from a distance are important.  They will slowly kill you while you are trying to focus on a troll or two uruk-hai.  In a solo game, your companions will focus on the nearby enemies leaving it up to you to take them out.  When facing an armored enemy, youll need to disrupted its attack to do any real damage (block, pushback, and attack).  Colored symbols will appear above an enemy when it is close to being defeated.  When the symbol turns yellow, you finish the enemy off with the strong attack key- this is not a power move.  This attack will decapitate or remove a limb from the enemy. The importance is that it seems to unlock an attack multiplier that increases your damage until you are hit.  This will be important when facing certain enemies. It was smooth sailing for the first levels until I hit a small boss that literally killed me 5 times before I could figure out how to approach the fight differently.  The bonus damage from the attack multiplier will make these fights much easier.

2.0,False,"05 14, 2011",A1NBXD6CO6TEKU,B003ZJ5B4I,B.Braunstein,"Firstly, this is NOT a gaming keyboard. Anyone who claims that it is a gaming keyboard is no doubt comparing it to one with rubber dome style switches (switches are the part of the keyboard that makes each key work). Almost all keyboards use rubber dome switches, which is the same type of switch your TV remote uses. This includes the expensive Logitechs. That's right, those super expensive ""Gaming"" logitechs use the same type of switches for their keys as your TV remote and that $4.99 super saver keyboard.

This keyboard uses Cherry MX Blues. These keys have an incredibly light touch and long travel to reset the key, which makes them unsuitable for gaming. They are WONDERFUL for typing.

What exactly does this mean? Cherry MX Blues were designed with TYPING in mind, not gaming. These keys will respond subtly with tactile and auditory feedback (touch and sound). If you are gaming you are going to be pushing the keys down most of the way anyways, and will have a sound and a small snap as your only feedback on keystrokes. You actually have almost no feedback until the snapping feeling and the clicking sound, which means that you have almost no feed back as to how far into the key press you are until you trigger one of these effects. The switch that is actually best for gaming Cherry MX Blacks, has no clicking, and very slightly gradually increases in resistance as you press. This means you can feel how far into the key press you are by how much push is on your finger.

The huge issue with these keyboards is that they are marketed as gaming keyboards and that in gaming, unlike typing, we hit the same few keys over and over, and often very quickly. The problem with these keys is that they are not good if you like to ""hover"" with keys slightly pushed right above the point where they actuate (when it counts as being pressed). People often do this, without knowing it--for example if you are inching around a corner in an FPS. Because of the tactile feedback (which is ""snappy"" for lack of a better word) and the long movement between pressing and reset. To inch forward rapidly you have to almost completely release the key before you can press it down again. No hovering right above the actuation point, it won't work. Many people refer to this as a double-tap issue. Basically, if you attempt to inch forward and are spamming a key it will not do anything a good portion of the time, because you have not released it far enough to reset it.

Doesn't make sense? The actuation point is the point at which the key counts as being pressed. On all Cherry MX mechanical switches (blue, red, clear, black, etc.) this is 2mm and the keys bottom out at 4mm.

 If press the key down to, or below, 2mm it will count as being pressed.
 If you then slightly let the key up above 2mm it will not longer count as being pressed.
 On Cherry MX Blues, which these keyboard uses, in order for it to count as pressed again it has to go to about only 1mm or less depressed before it can count as being pressed again.
So if you want to spam forward and release in an FPS you are going to have to move the key considerably, and furthermore you are going to have to at times wait for the key to come up--if you are very fast (these keys are very light). Why is this an issue? Waiting for the key only takes a moment you say? Because if you DO press before it's reset and plan on holding it to go forward. It may take you a fraction of second to realize you are NOT going forward in the game.

How does this translate to RTS (real time strategy) like Starcraft 2; or a MOBA like DotA, HoN, or LoL? If you are sending commands to units really quickly, you make discover that some will not receive these commands.

Some claim that you can work around this, and adapt to using the keyboard--this is partially true. But if you press keys quickly, or aspire to being a PRO level gamer, which is after all why you are looking at such an expensive basic keyboard, right? The keyboard WILL cause you to have to adapt to IT instead of enabling you to play as you would naturally. In order to have a RESPONSIVE keyboard that you can actually FEEL when you are quickly pressing a few command keys, the only two options are really Cherry MX Black switches ($70 to $160) and the ULTRA-expensive Topre swiches ($250 and up for a keyboard).

Thermaltake Meka G1, Deck Legend, Deck 82, Steelseries 7G, and Steelseries 6Gv2 are all keyboards that use Cherry MX Black switches. After much research I am buying the Steelseries 6gv2 and will be returning this Razor Black Widow to the local store as soon as it arrives.

FYI far more SC2 pros use Steelseries than Razor. This counts for the ones without a Keyboard manufacturer as a sponsor, as well.

I hate to say it (because I like the loose concept of the game), but I was disappointed with Shenmue. I have to give recognition to the fine artistry and graphical quality. However, herein lies the problem.
So much emphasis was put on the graphics that they forgot to add the game. Shenmue really isn't a video game at all. It is more like you are watching a movie and every once and awhile you have to pause it, do some tedious task, and then you get to watch a little more. You really don't feel like part of the game. It often felt to me that I was not playing at all, but watching someone else play. I kept waiting my turn, and before I got my turn the game was over. This problem was also exemplified by the fact that you can not die (lose, be killed, whatever you choose to call it). I don't know about you, but I like a bit of a challenge. Not even having Ryo's fate in my hands made me feel even more like a bystander.
One other problem I have (probably the most significant to me) is that after all that ""playing"" you find out that you are just going to have to wait for the next video game to see what happens. You can form your own opinions about that, but I have to admit that I felt a bit taken. I just wanted to play a game. I didn't sign up for some long-term deal where I would have to buy several sets of discs to find out what happens. They should call the game Shenmue: Chapter One. At least then you would know that your entire [money] is going to only one chapter and not an entire game.
If you want to see some great graphics and casually watch one chapter of a story unfold, then this game is for you. However, if you want a challenge, the possibility of losing, a game that may come out differently if you were to play it again, I don't think Shenmue is for you. I recommend Half-Life and Final Fantasy 9 for many hours of video game enjoyment. Happy gaming.","Good Graphics, but they forgot the game!",975283200,17,,

And lets be real, DK2 was a joke compared to the original Dungeon Keeper, which kept us up all night, slapping imps around to fortify walls before the heroes could find a weak spot. And the battles for the map with other DKs were nothing short of epic. I think of the tactics we had to develop to get the computer DKs to exhaust their gold and lose their trained minions, then charge in on a direct route to their Heart and take them out.

On the final map, we tunneled between the heros' lair and the computer DK, then fortified our entrance to that new hallway, and doored it with our best doors, and trapped it, and moved our Training Room behind the traps, then knocked on the computer DK's ""door"" and ran, and knocked on the heros' door, and ran, and they met in the middle, and we sat back and laughed as the battle raged back and forth. When they were both spent, we took the badly weakened heros out, built a Treasury near their gold, and marched down the hall to the computer DK's lair and took him apart viciously on the way to his Heart.

And after that, all we got was weaksauce DK2 (not even close to DK). And Kalypso thinks they can foist this ""Dungeons"" on us with a little scripted action and total lack of in-game tactics and strategy ? I think not. I'd send it back, but its not even worth the return shipping cost.

To get the game to run at first I had to run it at a max of 1440x900 on a GeForce 660 GPU with the few graphics enhancements to choose from in the options turned off. I took this game as motivation to update my PC for the next generation of games. With an i7-4790k overclocked to 4.4ghz, 16gb of 2400 ram, an MSI GeForce 970, Asus Maximus Hero VII Motherboard, and the game installed to solid state drive, the game ran very well at 1080p, still capped around 30fps. I had some screen tear still during cut scenes, but this was in the game's unoptimized state when it wasn't available for purchase. For its current state, the graphics are excellent. Even at 1440x900 on the 660, graphics quality was decent. I'm sure with a few patches to fix the performance issues, it will look even better.

This game relied WAY too much on the Batmobile. I was excited about this feature when announced, but I never expected it to take over the game. The story caters to the use of the car as much as possible. It is often obviously forced. The Riddler challenges revolve around the car. You can't proceed to certain areas without the car. There are tanks EVERYWHERE that can only be eliminated with the car. Repeated Firefly missions are more reason to use the car. I didn't enjoy the Batmobile aspects and eventually just gave up. I threw in the towel after 17 hours and just watched the rest of the story on YouTube.

I enjoyed the story for the most part. It was predictable, as others have commented. You could see the Arkham Knight's identity coming from a million miles away, if you had some knowledge of Batman's history.

I didn't feel gadgets played as strong of a roll in this game as previous titles in the series. I didn't bother hunting Riddler trophies in this one either though. I've done enough of that in the other games. The combat is still very fluid, identical to previous games with the exception of team take-downs where both characters deliver nicely choreographed knockout blows. The team knockouts is probably my favorite new addition to the game.

The Penguin and Two-Face stories are bland and repetitive and have little to no story worth mentioning.

Nightwing's humor and bluntness with Batman were great.

Musical score is enjoyable and at times reminiscent to the Dark Knight film trilogy.

Overall, the game is a rehash of the mechanics from the previous games in the series, often dropping some of the fun of physical combat in favor of driving the Batmobile down your throat. I loved the combat in the previous games, so I'm not complaining there, but the Batmobile is just too much too often. The story is decent, but loses momentum because it's catering to the Batmobile.

MW2 can't seem to decide what kind of game it is.  For veterans of other Call of Duty and Medal of Honor games, MW2 will feel incredibly twitchy and hyper right from the beginning.  The speed and pace of the game feels more like Quake or Unreal, but you still have to aim down the iron-sight to get any sort of accuracy with your gun.  Because your movement and field of view is limited while aiming down the iron-sight, you'll find yourself spasming back and forth between aiming and running.

It doesn't help that many levels are filled with enemies who seem to spawn endlessly making it impossible to ""clear"" areas before moving forward.  This was annoying in the original MW, but it's even more apparent in MW2.  In order to complete levels, you have to just run to checkpoints, regardless of how many enemies are left in the area.  On some levels (like an army base), this kind of design makes sense but on others, it just feels downright stupid.

Basically, if you liked Modern Warfare and the older CoD or MoH games, don't buy MW2.

Last year they released a game called Trinity Univers which I loved, despite a really poor implemented item crafting system. It had great characters, a cute story, beautiful visuals, and a combat style I haven't seen since the Legaia series. It was great fun and a strong showing of how a classic, turn-based,  JRPG could be done on current generation console. When I saw Neptunia, hearing that it was the spiritual sequel, and had that same cute and colorful style, similar combat, and was being made by the same people, I jumped on it. Oh how wrong I was.

This game isn't done. That's the only explanation I can think of considering its lineage. It shares a lot of traits with Trinity Universe, but a lot of what made TU good is missing. The combat is greatly stripped down yet also somehow made harder to use. It uses a similar idea, but instead of a sequence of normal attacks triggering a special attack, you have to customize every single possible combination of 4 button presses, assign an attack to every single button of every single combination, and also make sure that you end on a certain type of attack to either string to a combo or switch members. While it sounds pretty interesting, it is executed so poorly and extraordinarily cumbersome and time consuming. On top of that, the fights are horrendously slow and dull. Everyone's attacks seem so slow and labored, it makes each swing take forever.

The combat is the worst of it, but there's other problems. The game makes fun of JRPG tropes, which is actually quite amusing during cut scenes, but the way it does it is do bad. This game NEEDED a world to make these jokes work, not just still images. Every time you interact with an NPC, they appear as a small, black silhouette.

All the dungeons are the same. I believe there was a grand total of 3 ""types"" of dungeon that I saw, though I didn't get very far. A cave, a warehouse, and a forest. Occasionally they changed color, or had fog, but that was it. Lump that with in the slow and repetitive combat and they've managed to make a dungeon crawler where you dread dungeon crawling.

Another problem is the healing - there isn't any. You'll find a number of multi-colored potions in treasure chests or after battles. This potions, in various combinations, are used in your healing/recovery skills. Here's the problem, you can't use them at will. You use skill points that you are allotted to set priories for your healing skills to trigger automatically when you take damage with certain health %s or guard under a certain health %, and so on. This means that you can easily end up in a position where you need to heal cause the next hit will kill you, but you can only heal when you get hit, thus putting you in a death cycle. I imagine later on this because less problematic later on when you have more points and can max out most of the ""conditions,"" but early on you'll have to flee from the dungeons because your party members are too weak to continue on and can't heal even though you're swimming in green potions.

The ""Game"" is bad, really, really bad. The characters are cut and funny and the setting would be unique if it had been fleshed out at all.  I only suggest this to people who are in it purely for the cute, comedic story line and don't mind slogging through boring dungeons and bad combat to get there.

I guess in other words, if you liked Final Fantasy 13 and want something a bit more humorous, get this game.

It was pretty linear with not much in the way of optional movement.  But the visuals were good and the behavior of the adversaries was OK.  I don't play online - usually just campaign mode so I can't comment on multiplayer.  And so from that perspective it was worth the $10.19 I paid.
I would have given it 3 stars and said it was a good value overall - kept me somewhat entertained - if you can call trying to kill imaginary things any form of entertainment - which I must or I wouldn't have bought it.  The problem I have with this game is the premise that any modern army from a civilized nation would behave in the manner claimed in this game.  I don't think it's possible for any large group of American soldiers to ever behave, orders from on high or not, in the manner that is the basic premise of this game.  The idea that an American Army would execute civilians on a mass scale such as this is preposterous to me.  I had read other reviews that made this game appear to be an anti-war statement - if so it fails miserably because ultimately it is really about nihilism - that no matter what choices you make everything is doomed.  Reminds me of some of the European fiction and movies that came out in the 20 or so years following WWII in which in war there was never any victor - everyone loses.  And while that is somewhat true - that everyone loses something in a war - not all wars are unjust - as in the case of WWII where fascist governments which put themselves above the people and had to be overthrown.  This lesson is something I think people tend to forget - that what we take for granted today, personal freedom, was won by taking life - for the most part the lives of innocents and the duped who wanted to believe politicians, who care generally only for themselves - but in some small numbers the perpetrators of atrocities against humanity like Hitler's Nazi Party, and the feudal military culture of pre WWII Japan.  We have a long way to go to grow out of that.  But blaming the citizen soldiers we employ to protect ourselves by portraying them as capable of these kinds of atrocities, as this game does, in such a realistic contemporary way is almost inexcusable.

First off, you need to be prepared for how short this game is. I've played games where the cinematics alone took up multiple hours, and to be honest with this game being based on a multi-year fantastic award winning series, with awesome actors, I was expecting that here too. However, the dialogue is often very trite, and there isn't nearly enough of it.

You are not one of the main characters from the show - instead you are an up and coming punk, a bastard child of Big Pussy. You are of course given silly little tasks at first, but as you prove your worth, they give you more and more challenging things to do. Often you're roaming around classic locations from the show.

Here's the problem. You would think with such a wealth of material to work from, and such fantastically complex, intricate plots, that they could easily pull off a multi-hour game. Sadly, that is not the case. Instead, you get a pretty straightforward series of activities that could come from pretty much any clone game.

The graphics are not stellar, either. The PS2 has been out for enough years that some rather impressive graphics have been created for it. There were numerous issues with The Sopranos that, really, a game with this kind of backing should not have displayed.

I do adore the Sopranos and admit it was fun to romp around in the Sopranos world. So let's take it for granted that some sort of game in the Sopranos WOULD be made, and that it would involve the cast members. That is never really a question here. The question is whether that world is a quality done world. I'm afraid the answer is - not really.

Certainly, if you adore the Sopranos, rent this game to see what it's all about. You'll probably get through it long before the rental period is up, and only have spent a few dollars.

Yakuza Is a highly overrated series kinda like GTA, but too the Japanese and some Weeaboo's, I mean Western fans, lol! With all that aside, here my short review.

 The story is now split into 4 characters. 1. money launderer, 2. cop, 3. escape prisoner, and the 4. is hero we all know from the Yakuza series. The story each one is really hard too follow this time around. It maybe because there 4 characters, or that the story REALLY drags on this time, but it's really hard to follow this time around. So I recommend you devote all of your attention too every long CS, because you'll become lost within the story really quickly if you don't. The Eng subs still works wonders in this game though, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Eng dub can, and 91% of the time be terrible, so no problems there. The game mechanics play just like a JRPG. You get into random battles, do amazing moves, level up skills, rinse and repeat.

Now the main problem I have with this game is (drum roll) everything is DATED! No improvements too graphics, gameplay, and after a while, the game gets pretty repetitive. I love the min games, I love the combat, which needs a big improvement, but all of it could of been improve. Sega might as well place a Yakuza X3 sticker on this, because that what it is.

Generally it is a lot of fun, and I like the idea of 1 hit kills, and injuries affecting your abilities to aim/run etc.  The poor AI and awful save system really drag it down though.

pros: The wide open maps, realistic damage and focus on strategy and spacial awareness make it a fun fresh approach to FPS gaming.

Cons: The graphics are underwhelming. The team AI is so stupid that once the player unable to command them all 3 can be easily killed off by a single enemy rifleman.  The enemy AI seems somewhat better, but they will still throw themselves into a prone position and crawl across open ground when they could have easily sprinted to nearby cover. The save system is probably the worst part about this game.  It is checkpoint based, but not every checkpoint registers a save, and combined with the one shot kills and the great distances/open map, that means A LOT of running.  You might to fight through enemy forces for 2 or 3 kilometers just to reach the objective, get shot in the face and start all over.

On the positive side Doom 3 reminds me of the PC game Aliens vs. Predator 2, which was scary as a single player game because of the darkness and theme. But AvP2 used the darkness to make the game fun despite the poor graphics. But while the graphics are good when the near constant darkness doesn't prevent one from enjoying them, the interface is too classic Doom. There is no realistic vision enhancement such as NVGs, or even lights mounted on weapons. Thus one must go from flashlight to weapons (of which there is the classic too many to really carry) and back again almost nonstop, which is lame in a high-science, future based game. Monster spawning is also lame as they spawn from cleared areas.

The worst aspect of this game is that the creators do not take advantage of even established innovations in FPS games, such as leaning or alternative fire/view.

Mario Galaxy is still far more fun to play... but the multiplayer option in this game is nice.  However, the gameplay is still quite akward, even with 2 players.  I will keep this game, and I am sure I will finish it one day.... but who knows when

[Original review]:Let me start by stating that I am a long-time gamer, and a die-hard Simpsons fan.  I have played every other Simpsons game to date, and have to admit that this one dissapointed me the most.  First, the good:
*The animation (cut scenes and gameplay) is great.  You really feel immersed in an Simpsons episode.  The game dialog and situations are funny and classic simpsons.
*Co-op mode was a good idea.  If it wasn't for the negative aspects of this game, this would have really shined.

Now... for the bad.
**The control schema for this game is BEYOND AWEFUL!!  The camera is difficult to reposition, the character movement is difficult.  In no time, I have a headache and am completely disgusted with playing this title!  This really ruined the game for me.  I died 9 times just trying to jump from donught to donught in the tutorial level!  Sad.  Perhaps the worst control schema I have seen on any wii game (and I have seen some pretty bogus ones!)

**WHAT!? No online co-op?  I think they really blew it not allowing you to choose an online partner to play the co-op mode.  I mean, its not like my wife is gonna sit down and play with me, right?  Seriously, any 2+ player game these days should be online compatible.  Tsk tsk.

Other than that, nothing else to say about this game.  In all seriousness, if the controls weren't so horrid, I could have beared playing this game further.

However, I was not exactly in for as good of a time as I expected. There were a few games I liked playing, but the collection as a whole is a step down from Intellivision Classics. This time around, not many games are particularly interesting. However, you do get to play some knock-offs like Space Armada, which is a Space Invaders clone.

The few games I did like playing were Snafu (a Tron light-cycles clone, but you can move diagonal), Pinball, Space Armada, and Night Stalker. But considering the amount of games on this cartridge, that isn't much enjoyment.

Plus, while the controls are considerably better than on the original Intellivision, the emulations fall flat in the sound department, where the sounds have been downplayed to Atari-esc beeps and bloops. This ruined Snafu's catchy music (When it plays), and it takes away from the nostalgic value.

Following the innovative and brilliant original DS, the anticipation was so great that minor flaws would be forgiven. With DS2, though, it was one big blunder after another.

Contrary to the original DS (for which one had to physically tear himself from the computer screen) this one is a boring chore. Running back and forth to the base camp to barter equipment is a tedious procedure with all the fun sucked out of it. Moreover, no matter how much you improve your character (either leveling up or equipment-wise), your enemies simply match your abilities (or resort to crowding) resulting in NO CHANGE in the gameplay. I am not talking new enemies, but aren't higher leveled characters supposed to easily wipe out enemies encountered many hours before? This way, the whole game is nothing but a even-leveled blandness.

On a similar note: why was it necessary for **minor** enemies to have so much life? I was bored out of my skin hacking and slashing FOREVER! Increase the damage they can cause and keep it interesting - do not give them a longer life only to artificially increase the game's duration!
Oh, and the enchanting system was a joke - since the items found were much better than anything one could pay to have forged.

Graphically, DS2 is not even one step higher than the original DS. Shadows and particles may have increased, but characters (and equipment) have not. As a result, the heat of the battle (even on high-end systems) will find you in the midst of a disorienting...blur.

Somewhere out there developers have begun lowering the bar on ""standards"" either out of lack of respect for the gaming community, OR they really don't care about their product in general. Either way, the main reason I bought this game was for the ""theatre mode"" which re-plays your saved matches. In other words, you duke it out in the game, and say you pull off a move that takes some serious skills or finess. So, the game offers for you to actually ""SAVE"" THE ""REPLAY"". Great. This way I can go back and see the awesome move I pulled, or even better I can go back and see the moves I missed and learn from where I made my mistakes.

Uh uh. Nope. The ""Replay Theatre"" that plays back your matches doesnt play back the matches you play, nor does it play back anything ""YOU"" did. All it does is place the same characters you fight with in the same arena you pick, and it has them auto-fight. It doesn't even record the wins/losses in the match. It re-plays absolutely NOTHING. You can save your combat matches that you play with your friends all you want, when you go to watch your perfectly timed tag-team moves in the replay you save... you are watching a bunch of crap that never ever happened. Whats even funnier is this game offers a computer vs. computer match where you can have people fight just for the heck of watching it, and it does the SAME THING as the ""re-play"" of the saved matches function.

In other words the ""SAVE YOUR REPLAY"" and ""WATCH YOUR REPLAY"" is a completely failed function of this game. I capture video game footage with Roxio. So I played a match, captured the footage, saved the re-play in the game. And as I played the ACTUAL CAPTURED FOOTAGE on my laptop while playing the re-play I saved in the game they were completely different in every way. On my laptop footage I won all the fights with one character in a tag team match. In the saved file of the re-play in the game i lost 2 out of three matches and both my tag team characters were fighting when i never used my partner AT ALL.

The Re-play function is NOT a working function of this video game.

The first two GH games were incredibly fun, you could play with friends and family, and laugh and have a ball while you tried to make it through the songs. You didn't have to be musically inclined or even a video game expert to play Guitar Hero, you just had to enjoy music.

Then, you had GH3 which cranked up the difficulty and alienated some of the hardcore yet casual fans. The focus seemed to be geared towards mastering the plastic guitar controller. Some songs, I couldn't complete on the ""hard"" level and bombed out after the first 30 seconds.

The iterations following GH3 have had many improvements, culminating with the excellent GH Metallica.

Despite seeing that many songs/artists on GH5 were not any that I've heard of before, cared for, and didn't belong on a GUITAR HERO game (Coldplay??), I bought it mainly for what I thought would be an awesome Guitar Hero Van Halen (SORELY mistaken!). I am trading in GH5 now while there is still some trade-in value left. The game is OK, but really, aside from the songs and unlockables, plus the ability to use your XBox Live Avatar as a playable character, there is nothing new about this game.

Guitar Hero should be about power-chord, feel-good songs like ""Working For The Weekend"" from Loverboy (how about ""Hot Girls In Love""?), but they tried to go with the mainstream here, and I think it sucked, much like today's music sucks.

Some of the songs from popular musicians are OK to play. Figured I'd give it a try, but honestly, if you paid full price for this game, you paid too much.

This highly anticipated title is a side-story to the orignal PE franchise which debuted in the late 90's.  The 3rd Birthday distances itself from it predecessors via gameplay style and story.  What we have here is a third person shooter in a similar vein Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War.

Ducking behind cover is automatically initiated upon positioning the main character, Aya Brea, next to obstacles on the map.  Due to the PSP's lack of a second analog stick, running is done with the only analog stick on the system and aiming is managed by locking on to enemies with the L should button and switched to different enemies via the D-pad.

This is a third-person shooter after all, so gone are the days of random battles with detailed inventory and stats menus.  The 3rd Birthday has retained a bit of its RPG pedigree with a rudimentary leveling system, weapon, and ""OE Chip"" menu.  The OE Chips are bits of DNA collected from killing enemies by ""Overdiving"" into them and exploding them into a bloody mess.  Honestly, throughout my time with the game I didn't really pay to much attention to the OE Chip system.  I'd equip some chips here and there to increase my stats such as healing, aim and whatnot, but I didn't really put too much emphasis or time into it.  That being said, the system does increase your stats so you will have to spend a little time with it.

Weapons; well I didn't spend to much time with either.  You can purchase various weapons to assist you in the game but I just found myself purchasing two rifles and keeping the standard pistol.  I upgraded their accuracy, capacity, et cetera and that was about it.  You can only equip three weapons and I found myself with the same three from beginning to end...except when overdiving into other people.

Also, there's kind of an armor system.  Kinda.  You can switch between wearing a jacket and not wearing a jacket.  Having the jacket on ups your defense stats, which slowly wither away with the amount of damage you take and the amount of clothes that are torn from Aya.  Yes, he clothes are torn off to the point that she's running around in close to a bra and panties.  Geez, Square....  I guess by beating the game you can unlock more outfits such as a sexy maid's outfit and whatnot.  (At least that's the one I unlocked when I beat it.)

Now for overdiving.  Overdiving is a technique in which Aya transplants her consciousness and possesses anther human being.  You'll inherit the abilities, and a fourth weapon, of anyone you overdive into.  You can also overdive into helicopter pilots and tank operators for more military might.  Additionally, upon inflicting enough damage on an enemy, a triangle will appear on the enemy indicating to you that you can overdive and inflict massive damage on the enemy or make them explode.

How does all this stuff I just cover mesh into the rest of the game?  Well, its cool, I admit but the story is a convuluted mess which is really just there for the sake of progressing the game from level to level.  The non-playable characters lack any sort of palpable depth to them and come in and out of the script with really no bearing on the game, or caring, but the gamer.

The gameplay itself is mediocre and consists of running of room to room killing all enemies and moving on to the next.  Towards the end of this, albeit, short game I really found myself just slogging through it just to be finished with it.

The graphics are very good, not as great as Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, but definitely make the PSP shine.  FMV sequences are very well done and the music is stellar.

As a diehard RPG fan of the ""old days"" (NES and SNES rockin' the best ones in my opinion), I couldn't help but desire an ""RPG maker.""  After all, I don't buy PC titles unless they include the very important words ""Map Editor Included"" or something similar.

For me, customization is my game.  I typically spend hundreds of hours (probably thousands, more like it) just in the customization of games as I make scenarios and then tie them to my campaigns.

However, here comes my bleak recommendation...

I will support all things associated with classic RPGs until the day I die.  In fact, it was Final Fantasy that inspired me to do this sort of thing.  My dream is to make an old school, Final Fantasy-quality RPG some day.  RPG Maker 3 is the next step to do that shy of dropping cash to get an advanced education, a new PC, new skills, and programming software and books.

So in reality, my recommendation is that you support all things RPG, trying to find ways to make them popular in today's society.  (Obviously we RPGers are a small number, comparatively speaking.)  But titles like RPG Maker 3 are our voice in this world of fast-button-pushing video games that seem to corner the U.S. market.

This title was made for us, even if it can't compare to Final Fantasy 1 through 12 (no matter how good you are with it).

In all reality, if you love classic RPGs, you will like RPG Maker 3.  To love it would require a different desire regarding RPGs, I would think.  But your creative imagination will not decrease from utilizing this product, however, and RPG is the name of the game.

While this may seem like a good deal, you can actually buy the second expansion in the Civilization series, Civilization: Conquests, which is included with the first expansion as well. So if you'd like an even better deal, buy a copy of the original Civilization game (which sells for a VERY cheap price new or used) and then buy the Civilization: Conquests expansion and you'll spend the same amount you would for the Gold Edition, get the expansion Civilization: Play the World as well as new content in Civilization: Conquests.  If you'd like to know what the Gold Edition brings to the table, basically the purpose of the Play the World expansion was to enable multiplayer, a feature once originally promised in the original game.  Atari probably realized it could make more money holding out multiplayer in an expensive expansion pack but if you never gave in to Atari's demands, now is your chance to try it.  Multiplayer is a bit of a disappointment in Civilization.  The online community isn't large and it's not the same thing as randomly joining a server in a first person shooter or other poppular online game because of the dedication required for long online games.  One reason the community isn't that large is because when Play the World was first released it was a buggy disaster! The online game was full of lag no matter what game mode or connection speed you used. Some of the common problems have been fixed with patches but multiplayer has never been a great success with Civilization.  Play the World even introduces a simultaneous turn mode which allows the game to speed up and imitates the mechanics of a real-time strategy game.  Unfortunately, Civ 3 really isn't meant to be a real-time strategy game and it doesn't run as smoothly as a Rise of Nations or Warcraft game would.  If you have a home LAN, that's probably the best way to play Civilization against others.  The most successful method of play is still singleplayer, though, so I recommend you buy the Conquests expansion along with the original Civilization game like I mentioned above because that expansion does a better job adding more features for singleplayer but also comes included with the content in Play the World.",Nice Game but Unnecessary Purchase,1076112000,95,,

FIrst, a little history. Street Fighter 4(the original) came out with Windows Live. You had to have a constant internet connection in order to play that game to it's fullest. You could still play the original Street Fighter 4 offline, but you couldn't play your saved games and it wouldn't save your progress, you were also limited to only half of the fighters, because you had to unlock them all in the original. If you didn't always log into Windows Live everytime you started the game, you weren't able to access the other fighters you unlocked. What the original Street Fighter 4 had, was a DRM where you needed a constant internet connection to play.

Did they change the DRM in Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition? Yes, and no.

DRM in the Arcade Edition is still Windows Live. You need a Windows Live account and you will always have to be logged into Windows Live, thus you always have to be connected to the internet, to play Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition to it's fullest. They have now all the characters unlocked, so if you want to play offline, you can do so with all the characters, however you must download a patch through Windows Live first before all the characters become unlocked. Saving still only occurs if you are logged into Windows Live and only if you are connected to the internet. If you don't have an always online connection, you won't be able to play your saved games, nor will you be able to save your progress, just like how it was in the original Street Fighter 4.

1. The clip area was not deep enough to hold the Vita satisfactorily.  If they would've just made it maybe 1/2 in deeper, and not angled, it would've worked perfectly.  This was made to hold a smartphone, so I'm sure it works just fine for that.  But I have the newer Vita, which is probably the thickness of a phone with a decent case, so I could see this being a problem if you have your phone in an Otterbox or similar case.  I tried the binder-clip mod, but it did not work well.  It did not take much movement at all to have the Vita shake loose.

2.  The mount itself attaches to the controller with these rubber-band style connectors.  It makes it less expensive to manufacture, but the mount with a phone does not feel as solid as it would otherwise.  The rest of the mount feels pretty well-made and well-engineered, so I could see this being modified to being a more solid mount.

The dead pixels issue is probably the biggest annoyance so far. Sometimes these are small, and sometimes they're pretty big and detract from the overall gaming experience. And to the reviewer who said that it's ""not a big deal""...are you kidding me??? I don't know about you, but when I fork over $300+ dollars of my hard earned money, the hardware damn well better work like it's supposed to!! Would you buy a plasma TV if it had multiple defects?

Sony is recommending that you wait 2 weeks to see if the problem clears up, and then they'll ""see what they can do"" to fix it. Gee, that's nice of you Sony. Sell someone a faulty product and then tell them ""too bad, so sad"". Wonderful marketing tactics!

The battery life is an even worse issue. If you play a graphic intensive game (like Ridge Racer), under IDEAL conditions you can get 6 hours of battery life.

Folks, please use your wits and wait a while. Anyone can tell that this product is still in the experimental stages.

You and your squadmates are members of a galactic military recon unit, sent to pacify and reclaim a far flung colony from the tyrannical ARM. In the single player campaign, you play as Sergeant Corde, who watches his squad butchered by an enemy defector.

The graphics in Section 8 are surprisingly bad given its predecessors and contemporaries. Wide open spaces don't flow well, and urban structures make it difficult to pick out fine details, like enemy soldiers, until they begin firing on you, and you're forced to follow their energy lines back to where they are. All the text is rendered in incredibly small, blurry bright white, and the HUD emblems are barely distinguishable from one another, and there's no zoom function on the map you get a better look.

Audio is horrific. The general can't speak in anything other than a patriotic baritone, and you can almost hear a fanfare playing in the background whenever he speaks. Enemies are stereotypical nazi-esque villians, and in the few scenes they're featured in, they're speaking in tones and inflections more reserved for discussing the finer points of live puppy roasting. You're almost expecting them to charge into combat to the battle cry of ""Evil rocks!""

Gameplay is where the game falls completely flat. You are immortal, so the single player campaign is an exercise in how long it takes you to die, respawn, and run across the stage back to the engagement zone, and its really a trial against how long you're willing to put up with that. The multiplayer is genuinely well balanced, outside of certain stages making certain classes worthless. Being able to customize armor is a neat feature, though options are not explored enough. Ordering in support is bizarrely delivered, and while you can deploy turrets and supply points, you can't call in artillery.

It's buggy and unbalanced, playing more like a Beta than a finished product.  Two examples:  In towns it's possible to get random quests, that for some reason give no reward on completion.  Also the respawn rate for enemies is way too high, as you can head off on a quest, fight your way through various mobs to do so, only to find they've all respawned in the minute or so you were out of the area. Hell, they'll even respawn while you're buying stuff or getting your non-existent reward!

It's also pretty lame running up to a rival and just keep smashing a button over and over until they're dead. Mages and archers have a very good advantage compared to the others.

There is a big disappointment in the story lineage. It's kind of like taking DA:Origins and cutting the storyline in a third and just extending the secondary quests. Also, one of the biggest reasons I loved DA:Origins, is you could literally spend an hour or two just talking to your companions either upsetting them or flattering them. Not so in this game.

True, you are able to import saved characters from Origins to introduce different aspects, but the game really only has brief cameo appearances from the original companions (excluding Anders).

I'm so familiar with the Madden line that I can play the newest addition and tell you which positional AI was changed to provide a more realistic football game. Unfortunately, EA and Microsoft could never work out a deal regarding Xbox Live so the best way to play ANY football sim (human vs. human) isn't available on the Xbox's Madden unless you have company. Thus I decided to learn ESPN NFL Football.  Like everyone will tell you, ESPN Football has one heck of a slick presentation. The halftime and weekly highlights almost feel like you're watching ESPN Sportscenter.  Madden could learn a lot from ESPN's presentation. I usually ignore franchise mode when I play Madden but I thought ESPN had such a nice interface that I ended up playing the CPU a lot.  Unfortunately, I never could get used to the game mechanics of ESPN football.  One huge difference between Madden and ESPN is that players move much more realistically in Madden. Momentum is gone in ESPN and it almost feels like I'm controlling a player in an NFL Blitz game because it's so easy to cut and turn. But worst of all is the attrocious tackling in ESPN. You can play on the toughest difficulty level and an average halfback can look like Earl Campbell because he bounces off so many tackles. Speaking of difficulty levels, that was a real disappointment as well.  Basically, when you increase the difficulty, all it does is make the CPU tougher, and you worse.  So you can't tackle as well as your normally would but the CPU tackle goes way up!  There are a lot of things in ESPN I wish Madden would try and I think if someone were ever able to combine both games, we would get the perfect football sim, but for now I'll stick with Madden.  I would recommend ESPN for anyone that is new to football games as it's much easier to play than Madden and has an entertaining ESPN theme to it.  There's a reason why NFL players stick with Madden though, it's still the best football sim out there.","I Really Wanted to Like This Game, But I Still Prefer Madden",1071446400,,,

3.0,False,"02 3, 2010",ADJKMC7AO7YN3,B002673XJA,Jayson Olson,"Like many, I've really been looking forward to an MMO that breaks both the typical 'fantasy' genre or better yet linear progression structure of many MMO's out there, and while there was much hype to this game and it does have it's shining moments, at this early stage I feel it will be forgettable in a matter of time.

One of the main problems STO faces is the challenge that lives up to the hype and IP franchise of promising to be 'The' Star Trek game.  Gene had a vision of creative solutions and thinking outside the box while introducing people to cooperative factions and exploration.  Well, unfortunately at this point the game thus far is reduced to one core component: combat.  While one may argue that all games must have a combat element (and I agree), in this new ST outing, Gene would be very disappointed to learn that the Federation is asked to shoot first, ask questions later.

As other reviews have stated, the majority (note: not all) of missions are go to X and kill Y.  Or collect Z and report.  Perhaps it is too much these days for developers to flex a bit more creative muscle and come up with more than the traditional and tired mission types that are no different from all the MMO's before it.  I for one was really hoping to do more 'diplomacy', 'exploration', and 'scientific'-like missions, but in the end, there jsut isn't that feeling.

Being that it is Cryptic and NCSoft, and having played CoH/CoV for 5 years myself, I still can't help but feel that this is a slightly more enhanced version and re-skinned version of those games.  Right down to the font type, crafting and auction elements, these are VERY similar to CoH/CoV.  Although I will give NCSoft/Cryptic credit...they do support CoH/CoV with numerous expansions so one can assume that they will also support STO for years to come.

Not to sound totally negative, there are some bright spots: 1) Character creation is very deep and I haven't seen any other game close to the amount of detail one can let loose not only on their main toon, but their supporting toons as well.  2) Ship battles are fun and add a nice touch of strategy to them while keeping an eye on various weapons, shields, and ship systems.  3) Space graphics are more advanced than previous Cryptic/NC games which is nice, but still a bit behind others.  4) Sound effects are dead on.  5) There appears to be a lot of unique modifications one can make to your ship over time not just in look but buffs and devices as well.  5) Open instances can be fun if you get the right mix of players all vying for the same goal.

Now a few tarnishes:  1) It just doesn't live up to the 'feel' of Star Trek which may detract from my pre-release expectations.  2) Ground/Away-team combat and missions needs work.  Animations and collision detection seem 'off', and already so early in the game I notice all these 'strange' new worlds and civilization are already repeating tile sets...(here's hoping that the devs will flesh this out later).  Same goes for the missions.  After you do a few of them (they are fun the first time around), they all seem to repeat their objectives yet again.  3) Chat channels are abysmal....here's to hoping they may support 'Vent' or other 'audio' based ones in the future.  Dare I say ""Barren's Chat"" (all you WoW players will know) can be easier to follow at times.  4) Some ship elements like 'scan' are very shallow and are one trick ponies at this point.  There is a lot of rinse and repeat type missions and exploration is questionable.

Reading all this is not to say this is a bad game.  I played the Beta and now the final, and I suspect there is much more content to come.  Perhaps wait a few months before you pick this up to see what the dev's have in the pipeline.  If you never played CoH/CoV or Champions Online, you'll probably get much more kick out of this than I am so far, but if you have, then you'll quickly note the same formula/feel and think you've played this before, it just has a Star Trek 'overlay' to it.",Fails Gene Roddenbarrys vision,1265155200,8,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

3.0,False,"06 15, 2012",AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B00029QOQS,Brittany Rose,"I recently visited a real theme park and had a pretty aggravating experience with how the park was both laid out, and guests were managed in terms of line-ups. I resolved that I could do better, and when I got home, decided to revisit the RCT series. I'm a huge fan of the second game in particular - it improved upon everything on the first game except for the graphics, but instead of reverting to that one I thought I'd try my hand at RCT3, which I'd avoided when it came out a half-dozen years ago because I was told it was disappointing.

The sad thing is, I truly agree. Not because the game is buggy for me at this point (the copy I have is clearly post-every-patch-ever + my computer is in much better shape than anyone's would've been at the time). But because the game is lacking the soul of the previous installations. Namely with the Career mode. The gist of this new mode is you have three levels of success per scenario, each of which gets (mildly) increasingly harder. The trick? You can view the goals for the third level, and since they tend to build on one another, if you just 'build' to the third level, you'll easily surpass levels one and two. By making it more mini-goal oriented in this way, I also don't really spend time working on my park. It's become very much about 'hit the goals' as opposed to 'build a park that will help you hit the goals over a longer period of time'. I can easily pass all three levels of a scenario in one sitting of playing the game - usually under 90 minutes - which is notttt enough time to really get invested in your park in the way RCT2's scenarios forced you to play for years at a time. The goals themselves are also pretty repetitive and / or extremely easy to reach. Whether it's 'gain X much income in shop / ride ticket income' or 'build a ride with X requirements' or 'please a VIP with X type of experience', there really isn't a lot of variety.

What's frustrating is the scenario landscapes are actually really nice - I'd love to feel motivated to stick around and play for a good long time, but I'm just not. The graphics have taken an upswing, the range of rides and shops is hugely, massively expanded, and the two expansions for the game - water parks & safari parks - add quite a bit of fun, profitable gameplay. But there seems to be a disconnect between all the features (including the much-lauded but ultimately annoying light shows, and the fun but basically useless coaster cam) and the actual function / heart of the game. The game engine seems a little wonky - the way peeps rarely (if ever) re-line up for a ride or decree a shop is too busy if there's more than one person there or just spend most of their time 'meeting with group' as opposed to actually experiencing the park (which causes cash flow issues to boot).

SC:Conviction might best be summed up as ""Splinter Cell: Nerf Edition"".  The gameplay mechanics have been overly simplified and the series has taken a new direction in what I can only imagine was the result of the publishers' desire to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the stealth niche.  Stealth is still a factor, but takes a backseat to the more action oriented style of gameplay.

I guess I should qualify those statements.  Stealth elements have been simplified.  Your list of available actions have been simplified, no suspending yourself above the action via a mid-air split, no moving through tight places via a narrow gap, reduced heat/night vision options, inability to carry bodies to dark corners to prevent detection, no lock picking or hacking, a complete lack of stealth option in many scenarios, etc.  These have been replaced with a few things that show that the new intent is for the series to be an action oriented game.  A new cover system, a large selection of weapons that have no silencers (not stealthy), frag grenades and remote mines, scenarios where the only way to progress the story is through killing enemies, etc.  They've also added the action oriented mark & execute.  It's basically a feature to kill multiple enemies with one button press.  This ability is earned by executing an enemy (close quarters kill).  So in short more killing, less stealth in the series.

Another aspect that pushes the title in a more action oriented direction is the lack of performance grading that occurs at the end of the level.  You would be rated according to the number of times you were detected and your body count.  There was a lot of replay value to be found in the older titles that revolved around repeating levels with the goal of not having any detections or kills.  This has been replaced by a new system that awards you ""PEC"" points for performing certain tasks as you progress through the levels.  These points can be used to upgrade weapons.  Again, many of the tasks that award points show how the game has taken a more action oriented approach.  Head shots, blending back in AFTER detection, killing enemies via making them fall to their deaths, etc.  Some PEC points do revolve around stealth, but not many.

The ""Splinter Cell"" moniker creates a certain expectation among gamers, the expectation of a high quality stealth game.  There's nothing wrong with taking a new direction and becoming a more action oriented game, but people should be aware of the change.  I can see people expecting a stealth game being severely disappointed with this new direction.  Again, the publishers are either trying to appeal to a wider audience or prevent the gameplay from getting stale due to similarities with previous titles.  Change isn't necessarily a bad thing, but again the name Splinter Cell has certain connotations and action shooter hasn't been one of them.  Perhaps this game would be better received with a different name, but a new name may not generate the same level of sales that an established name would.

Edit:  I should also point out that the language in this game is beyond reprehensible.  I don't believe there is one line of dialogue in this game that doesn't include some form of offensive language.  I imagine they included such harsh language in an attempt to come across as more ""adult"" or mature themed, but the coarse language adds nothing.  I suppose language, when used sparingly, can add to the tension of some moments but the level of overuse in this game is borderline comical.  So in addition to ""Nerf"" this game could have easily been called Splinter Cell: F-bomb Edition.",Nerf Splinter Cell,1273449600,10,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

1. LOUD! Very loud Fan noise - Sounds like a Twin engine airplane in your living room.
2. Setting up for Media Center Extender for my Media Center 2005 PC failed as it complained about not being able to create a ??user?? on my PC in the final stages of XBOX 360 Extender Software on MCE 2005, I spend few hours battling this issue but gave up as it was not worth the hassle of reformatting my PC and loading all the crap again to get the MCE extender functions to work. If the Unit was silent in my living room I would have sat and worked on the quirks of Microsoft's Xbox 360 extender crap installation process. - Your mileage may vary.
3. DVD playback is so-so... Why buy Xbox 360 for DVD playback? You can get EL cheapo DVD player for $30

To all XBOX 360 admirers:

Do not get me wrong, I am not trying to say XBOX 360 Elite is bad product, But as I am a casual gamer, the reasons for having a XBOX 360 was to use it for MCE extender for watching HD content from my MCE 2005 PC (Pause Live TV and use the MCE 2005 functions on XBOX 360)

XBOX 360 has a large collection of games and it plays them beautifully using HDMI output found in Elite on large Screen TV.

3.0,False,"08 17, 2014",A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000ID61,Bryan,"People used to make a big deal how Star Fox 64 was supposedly an improvement over the Super NES's Star Fox.  Not in my world it's not.  Star Fox 64 uses eye candy and colorful animations to disguise several moments of mediocrity.  No doubt it uses eye candy to disguise the lack of challenge.  The reason the Super NES's Star Fox was so successful is because it's able to combine challenge with really intense atmosphere giving the gamer the impression he's helpless in the galaxy (especially whenever your life is low- a feeling you hardly encounter in Star fox 64).  The pressure would get really intense whenever you begin to lose your teammates (Peppy, Slippy and Falco) and you wonder how much longer you'll be able to survive.  However I feel no pressure whatsoever in Star Fox 64 regardless how many of my animal friends go down or how low my health meter is.

I think the game is going for a cinematic feel while completely ignoring a degree of challenge.  The game certainly *looks* good.  Another problem is that the enemy variety is really lackluster and you're hardly ever swarmed with too many enemies which is a negative in my book because it means the intensity of the flight shooting isn't quite strong or memorable enough overall.  The music is another major disappointment.  Whereas on the Super NES the music was extremely catchy, suspenseful and memorable, no such treatment occurs here in Star Fox 64.  Instead every stage has quiet generic hard rock with no noticeable melody and it sounds really average to me.

While I don't mind having your team constantly radioing in and giving advice, it was a better format on the Super NES when they didn't actually speak.  This is because Peppy, Slippy and Falco talk a LOT.  Slippy in particular sounds like a child which is grating.  The enemy Andross talks a lot too.  Every few seconds you'll hear them speak and while some of the stuff they say is surprisingly enjoyable, I don't really want to hear it every time I fly a mission.  Most everything they say is playful anyway.  The explosion of enemy aircrafts tends to feel like an afterthought too, with no suspense occurring there either.  Tame explosions instead of violent and memorable ones like in the original Star Fox.  This is partly due to enemies appearing significantly less frequently than in the Super NES's Star Fox.

Well let me mention the levels.  Meteo is decent but a boring imitation of the same type of dark space stage we see in the Super NES's Star Fox where you're constantly surrounded by flying boulders and a high danger level.  In fact that's the biggest problem with this game- you swerve around traps and enemies *some* times, but it's never a very threatening or frequent occurrence.  It's a very tame flight you're taking most of the time.  Fortuna is a generic level with lots of flying and very little action.  Sector X is a high point due to featuring several moments of swarming around dangerous traps and closing objects while Titania is a pretty decent level while driving around on the ground in the landmaster vehicle.

Boise Defense Outpost contains a force field, and it gets tedious chasing enemies for a while.  Katina is tedious as well since it takes forever to open hatches on enemies.  It's boring.  Solar is awesome however since it involves dodging giant snake-shaped fireballs.  Macbeth is a train chase on the landmaster.  It's a pretty fun stage but the boss fight is once again tedious since it takes forever to defeat.  Sector Y is an awesome outer space dark level avoiding floating space crafts.  Aquas Ocean is even MORE awesome!  Hey alright, some memorable levels for a change.  The statues you fly past are quite intimidating and the sight to see in this stage.  The eye candy graphics from the explosions are unique too.

Toxic Waste Area is a unique toxic ocean level with a tough as nails boss fight made of armor.  The snakes coming out of the toxic water is cool too.  Sector Z is generic and forgettable since it lacks combat.  Area 6 contains a memorable disappearing disc-shaped tentacle boss with a giant golden-colored planet in the background.  I admire this stage's appearance.  Venom: Andross Homeworld begins on a lackluster note featuring generic enemy chasing and shooting, but immediately after this part is over the level turns WAY more intense and atmospheric (claustrophobic in particular).  The Andross boss itself is memorable mainly for the intimidating appearance of his first form and less about the second form which involves shooting aimlessly and hoping you hit your target.

Boss fights feel significantly less suspenseful perhaps due to them being easy with predictable weak points for one thing, and also the lack of suspenseful music.  This is why the Super NES version is so much better.  Don't get me wrong guys, I *do* admire this game, but I almost never feel like playing it knowing a better version of Star Fox is out there.",decent space shooter,1408233600,,,

I thought it would be cool to be able to play alternate versions of missions and see old characters rendered anew, but it was just a let-down. Snake-Tales are hokey, silly, and really no fun (at least, that is how I felt). Snake-Boarding was pretty entertaining, but I will stick  to Tony Hawk thanks very much.
The one Mission in Snake-Tales that is really worth playing is the one where you get reunited with Meryl.  It seemed like a fun idea...until you actually got to play and had to deal with that horror of horrors: SLOWDOWN. Had the graphics been enhanced (like promised with the XBox Version, but never followed through) this would have been excusable, but this is Playstation 2 with the exact same game code no less. Also, in Snake-Tales, your trademark radar is disabled. Normally, this could be taken as a challenge, a chance to show our skills...but it simply becomes a pain, especially when you consider how really buggy the game is.
Here is what I mean: On the tanker, during a bomb disposal exercise, I quietly sneak down a staircase into the engine room. I spot a Gurlukovich soldier. Unaware of my presence, I crouch down on the stairs and go into first-person mode with my M9. I aim carefully so I can get him in the neck. I did not realize it at the time, but although I could see the laser-sight 'beam' aimed right on target, the actual 'dot' did not show up on the soldier (I guess the boringly technical way to describe what happened is that the sight 'dot' fell between two of the polygons). When I fired, not only did it not take him down, but it alerted him to my presence (even with a silencer) and then I had to deal with the attack team! After being annihilated (My USP only had 2 bullets), I tried again, this time waiting until the sight 'dot' was visible on the soldier's neck. I found that the tiniest movement of his head would cause  the dot to disappear. Again, normally I would see this as a challenge of timing, but...When I am aiming directly as someone's head, usually whatever I am shooting embeds itself IN the head rather than THROUGH the head!
But, if you can get past this fundamental flaw (which only shows up in Snake-Tales) the VR Missions are what really carry the game, and you have over 300 to choose from. They are just about the only part of the game done well.

I will say that this dance pad is one of the best I've tried unmodified and it's the best option I know of if you want one dance pad to work with both the Wii and the PC to play DDR3 and Stepmania (unless you can find 2 pads that fit your needs, the combined cost of which is less than the cost for this pad).

Bottom line, if you can get a dance pad with 1"" foam already inserted for under $30, buy it - and even then, you should STILL modify it to add a board back, fasten wires in place, etc.  Otherwise, your best option is to buy the cheapest dance pad you can find which is returnable with no restocking fee and compatible with your hardware/software, check that it works and then modify it per the great directions available all over the web (just search for ""mod dance pad"").","Typical soft dance pad, i.e. just barely adequate",1305244800,5,,

Certainly no argument from me given the limited amount of experience I have with these type of games, but keep in mind I hate turn based RPGs.  I avoided them like the plague during my Super NES obsession 20 years ago.  I think the combat stinks because you have to take hits to actually *deliver* hits during combat (hence the ""turn based"" part of the genre) and the storyline is usually overlong, elaborate and exceptionally grand and elegant in a phony/uninteresting kind of way.  The presentation is the same unbearably pretentious way.  If this were a movie I'd get completely lost or uninterested in a matter of minutes and would shut it off, but for the sake of a video game with a reputation as being the best ever and a can't miss title, I decided to keep going.

Chrono Trigger's storyline is enticing and lures me in during the first half but then other characters get thrown into the story such as Schala, Melchior, Janus and Prophet and it turns extremely confusing in a hurry.  The game should have continued the pace it had in the first half with the robot (really incredible that I actually feel sympathy for a robot in a video game of all places, but the game manages to make me feel bad for him), and even though I hate that a frog is part of the characters since it just seems totally silly to take an amphibian seriously, he's at least sometimes memorable.  Ayla's indiscernible english is a chore to read for the player (added worse by her frequent appearances throughout the quest, ugh).  Marle is confusing in the beginning which probably should have been taken as an indication that this game was going to be difficult to follow from a storyline perspective.  I guess she's a princess?  And she's several other people too?  Who really knows.

Magus is supposed to be the bad guy but then a character named Lavos comes out of nowhere and I get lost.  Right when Glenn and Cyrus appear that's when the confusion escalates and loses me to the point that I was never able to recover.  The truth is, a video game storyline needs to be kept short and simple for me to understand.  Chrono Trigger is the exact opposite of that.  It's cool if you guys like it though.  I won't knock the game and give it a low rating just because I have trouble understanding sophisticated storylines in video games.  This is a fault of mine- not the game.  But perhaps the worst aspect is all the time travelling.  NOW I'm totally lost.  I can't keep track of all the past, present and future events that take place.  Knowing exactly what to do with a mess of timeline portals has to result in me using a FAQ to figure out.

Do they still create turn based RPGs these days?  I can't bother to keep up with video games like I did when I was a kid.  I like the magic spells with the lightning, fireballs, icecube attacks, etc.  These are fun to watch and were really impressive back in the mid 90's.  Anyway a 3-star rating is fair.

Also, once you install Barbarian Invasion all your old save games will no longer function or work, while it patches everything you must start from scratch again instead of being able to play your old save games from the origional RTW.

So, for those that are just inlove with RTW and Creative Assembly it's a no brainer that they/you will rush out and buy this without thought. But, for the more patient, but, perhaps unaware that there is going to be a ""free"" patch in a few weeks it's important that you know this now before buying an expansion you might not really want.",Things you should know,1127952000,16,,

But the reality is its not that great.  There is a licensing scheme in place like Gran Turismo.

The graphics are nice . But the handling of the cars are terrible.  I used a USB controller and it feels horrible. I changed the controller for better response and calibrated it as well.  Still the steering seems not as responsive.

Plus there are more Euro players on the server than American players.  There are bad drivers just like in real life that like to grief players by following them all over with no purpose.

I hear Forza 4 is like this game. Except there are no licenses in Forza only player levels which is better.

It's not suited to be your primary controller on the PS3, but as a secondary controller for multiplayer games, it does the job. Control seems responsive enough, though not quite on par with the SixAxis, and I like the design. The internal fans, as laughable as they might seem, are actually a nice touch. I do get sweaty hands on occasion and it feels kind of nice. It's not anything I would have ever asked for, but it's a welcome bonus, if a slightly odd one.

The PSP version falls far short of the console versions. I bought this thonking that it would be cool to play against my friends online but I was very disappointed by the lack of online gaming (which is the reason I bought Socom.)
Beside the lack of online the game has other major flaws. Aiming with just one analog stick and the square, x, circle, and triangle button is very awkward.
However Battlefront does include the two major new features from its console version. First: playable hero characters, even though the hero characters actually aren't all that great and you can only have one on the map. Secondly: The space battles, which are really fun but lack the ability to go inside the enemies ship and sabotage from the inside.
The PSP version of Battlefront offers two different single-player modes: galactic conquest and challenge. Too bad they didn't include a story mode (Rise of the Empire).
Thoughout all these flaws, the game still sounds and looks good. The music is great but weapons sound pretty horrible.
Probably the biggest downside of the game is the number of maps you can play, 13. In the console version, I'm pretty sure there are 23 or 24. Oh well, buy this game if you want but don't pay 45 dollars for it. It's probably best to rent first.

1. I REALLY wish they had explicitly stated the natural cycle of the Xel'naga as told in book 3 of the Dark Templar Trilogy instead of making it so cryptic. Unless you've read the books it will make no sense.

2. The blow-up-Shakuras level, in addition to being extremely difficult, makes no sense. Why not just activate the temple like in Brood War? And what happened to the Uraj and Khalis?

3. The Alarak vs Ma'lash mission is a monumental pain in the ass and would've been far better if you could play it as a boss battle playing as Alarak in a 3rd-person action game level. Same goes for the final mission against Amon. The artifact holdout mission is also insanely difficult and unnecessary.

4. And finally... we come to the ending. BLIZZARD, WHAT THE BLEEP WERE YOU THINKING?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was expecting an epic finishing-off of Amon comparable to Sauron's, but instead, poof.

3.0,False,"12 21, 2012",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B0084380ZM,Lisa Shea,"Game of Thrones for the PS3 is billed as a prequel to the HBO series. What it really is is a prequel to a fully finished game.

We adore the Game of Throne series on TV as well as the books. We've seen the series many times. We were enthusiastically looking forward to the game release. We were disappointed with what the game provided.

The game starts out seeming interesting. There are two characters that you go back and forth playing, one being a Night's Watch brother and the other being a Red Priest.  You get some small amount of configuration - for each you can choose one of three basic battle techniques. These then affect your ""attack tree"" for building experience. The priest gets magic, and the fighter gets a dog to take over with.

You find various items along the way of your quests, mostly junk you just sell, but occasionally you do hit a useful item. There's an arena mini-game to hone your battle skills, and you bet on them as well. You can even bet against yourself and throw a fight. You do get some decisions along the way, and they affect how certain characters react to you later on.

Gameplay is frustrating. The game will auto-save when you head into a section, and if it's long and convoluted, you're sent all the way back to that spot. This issue then trains you to have to save after every single action which is tedious. Loading times are quite slow as well. By the end of the game it seemed like one was doing the same thing over and over again.

Graphics and sound were OK. Not stunning, but not atrocious either.

All in all, the game was not so awful that we gave up part way through, but it didn't leave us thrilled with the experience when we finished. It could have been so much more. The bar was set high by the novel and the actors in the series. The game doesn't rise up to those standards.

the story- the story is everything to me, i don't mean to spoil anything...but this must be said!!! ok, to start off... if you played the other tomb raider games starting from atleast legend...  you know that when lara was a little girl, her mother mysteriously disapeared, and ever since she's been trying to find her. many years later, lara is still trying to find her, and the clues her father left, lead her to a kinda cave thingy. she had a team with her, and this kinda energy monster thingy atacked them, and she lost her friend amanda in the dig. and then somehow she surrived and tried to kill lara because she left her there, and ofcourse she lost. and then lara demanded that amanda tell her where her mother is, and amanda tells her that she's in avalon. and that wraps up legend, now that was a pretty good story, and the end was really cool. now in anniversary it's basically the same story as in the original tomb raider... which is rather good. in which lara is contacted to do a job for a lady named jaquelin natla. and during this ""job"" she finds these three artifacts called the scion, which led her to find out that natla is actually a guardian of atlantis, that was banished for misusing the scion. then you have to beat natla because she was after the scion, and supposedly natla dies in the end. but in underworld, the developers decided to bring back natla... which makes no sense what so ever, because they use all the stuff from anniversary in underworld... i mean the story... kinda... and that was never supposed to happen, because it was just a fun remake of the original game. now i like that they used the story from legend, i expected them to, and then it just became completely boring. this has got to be the worst story in tomb raider history. i really don't want to spoil anyhting so i won't tell you what happens, but i will tell you that the story makes no sense and you will be very dissapointed if you get this, in the story aspect anyway.

graphics- well there totaly amazing, i love the graphics, there the best i've ever seen, so far. it's so life-like. the water effects are great, well except there's this weird thing that happens when she gets out of the water... its like she has a cold sore, or something near her lip, but after like a second it goes away. oh, and this is really cool... you actually get to shoot guns underwater, i mean besides the harpoon gun. oh and theres this weird tranquelizer gun... why the heck would you want to trank something for 2 seconds... it's useless! oh, and by the way, you can only have 2 guns at a time, it's like legend.

music- i loved the music in legend and anniversary, but it really really sucks in this one, theres barely any music, i mean besides normal backround music.

gameplay- well, ummm... it sucks, the controls are way way hard to get used to, and she has so many new things you can do, it's hard to know what your even doing. and the levels, well they're very slow, and not as exciting as you might have guessed... i mean it's called underworld!!! you would expect alot of cool demons and gigantic beasts that take like 60 million bullets to kill, but no... nothing cool like that, just big spiders, sharks, big lizards, tigers, these viking thingys, and mercinaries. that's it, no cool stuff, not even a boss, NOT ONE!!! you don't even get to fight that kraken in the preview!!! what's tomb raider without a boss at the end! for me, i think beating a boss is a way of showing off my newly learned skills, but no, no showing off. i know many people say it's much easier... well it is, way too easy infact... the puzzles are so easy, it's like it was made for a 2 year old. and yet, to get the treasures it takes hours, even to get one! the only good thing about the gameplay is that you get to go to really cool places, like southern mexico, and coastal thailand. oh, and one other thing... i was expecting a really cool thing they were going to do with the mansion, but nope, they dicided ""lets blow it up! we'll save alot of money!""... jerks!

replay value- it's surprisingly good. better than the others i'm pretty sure... and they all have great replay value!

now i'm not saying this is the worst game in the entire world...i'm just saying that if you wanted a game that suits the name tomb raider: underworld, your gonna have to look elsewhere. but, if your a long time fan of the tomb raider series, and you always thought it was way too hard and you never liked versing bosses... then this is the game for you.

P.S. a few more things you might want to know:... in the xbox 360 version there is 2 exclusive bonus levels, in the play station 2,3 and nintendo wii versions a few levels are mixed together, and finally in the pc version there is quite a few bugs... if you do get the pc version, i recommend you download the TRU patch, it fixes most of the bugs. i hope my review was helpfull:)","ok, wait....what?'",1248220800,2,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

As is the case with many games, the first three or four levels are really well done and impressive. It kind of starts to become less interesting afterwards. Spicy Horse, the developer behind the game seems to have tried to make a variety of very different levels that would appear like visiting a different world every time. The good thing is some of them turned out really well. The ""happy"" part of not yet corrupted wonderland looked great, the Queen's Castle has a lot of meticulous detail, the under sea world with the sailor and the walrus they look great. In fact for the first half of the game, this game has a relatively humorous tone. The game cleverly goes back and forth to and from the real world and The Wonderland. The environment and the characters in the real world create some of the most depressing imagery of the 19th century industrializing England you can imagine. This is not a Dickens Fair or Baker St. From Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes Adventures. The humans resemble evil trolls, the brick walls are dirty, there are beggars, and beaten prostitutes on the street. It can be unsettling. Once the player sees the wonderland it shows a big contrast to the ""real"" world. But of course, without spoiling the game, not all is well in Wonderland.

As I reached further levels deeper into the game I was disappointed to see rather poorly made areas. It was more and more trial and error platforming rather than puzzles and fighting. The Mad Hatter levels that represent a lot of mechanical work, gears, and insanity looked kind of big cubic shaped factories where everything was brownish and metallic in color. Closer to the end of the game the game changes the tone entirely and becomes a rather disturbing horror game, for which the M rating is well deserved, especially as the animated cut scenes uncover the plot.

It was pretty interesting to collect different items that furthered the story, the teeth that let Alice upgrade her weapons, and different glass figurines, each associated with one of the adults that played a role in Alice's life.

Unfortunately some aspects of the game were just really poorly done or were not paid attention to. The voice acting is very bad. Very often, as the character speaks, they lack inflection in the voice, which makes it difficult to understand what is meant. It is as if everyone was simply reading the lines. Monotone facial animations did not help with this issue either. The music playing in the background during gameplay is quite horrible as well. Sometimes it couldn't even be called music, but a bunch of sound effects that resembled a tune. One particular level with dolls just had kiddie toy sounds in the background.

Besides the sounds many areas were blocked by invisible barriers. Maybe if the developer had a small budget they simply did not have time to create real obstacles everywhere, so they inserted invisibly walls into every nook and cranny.

Pros:
-good character design
-creepy plot
-good boss battles

Cons:
-Repetitive
-Some levels were a chore to complete
-bad music and voice acting
-no replay value
-invisible walls everywehre.

Another important thing to remember is that the M rating is well deserved and no kid under 17 should be playing this game. If you are a parent, do not be fooled by the title ""Alice.""

Storyline

After around 2 years since the events of Human Evolution, Adam finds himself now working for Interpol as Serif Industries has fallen thanks to what is universally called The Incident. The historic moment when all Augs became murderous and has since led to distrust of the augmented and high levels of prejudice across the world. But specifically in Prague, where the game primarily takes place, the distrust has reached new levels as a segregated ghetto of a city has been built for the augmented and a train station bombing happens. All of which is blamed on the pro-Aug rights group ARC. Thus leading to Adam to take part in a multitude of missions to investigate the bombing, an incident that happens in Dubai, which serves as the tutorial level, and an investigation into the accusations of ARC being responsible for multiple terrorist attacks.

But thankfully the game isn't a straight forward shooter. With the ability to hack, hide, cloak, and other means of avoiding combat, for those of us who don't have the patience to duck, cover, and shoot, or aren't the type who like to run in guns blazing, there are options. In fact, playing a non-lethal game is entirely possible. Granted, it is a bit difficult, but even the final, if not the only boss in the game, can be taken down without firing a bullet. A quite neat option considering video games have come to a point where there is an increased desire to give the player options. Though while most game simply provides dialog choices, which this game offers and to a certain degree makes important, it seems almost revolutionary to offer the ability to simply knock out everyone and press on with your objective.

But I would be remiss if I didn't note how enjoyable both the story and side quests were. Now, I don't believe, even with around 2 days of gameplay, I found and played every last side quest and found every last item. I did try, but for reasons below I eventually came to a point where I just wanted to finish this game. With that said, be it doing a murder investigation, in which every clue mattered, to convincing people to trust Adam, much less the main plot in which I was led around to investigate ARC and the plans of some of its members, I did ultimately enjoy myself. Though what I especially enjoyed was the hacking mini-game which I almost wish was a mobile game in of itself.

Low Points

I played this game on a Steam controller and, as usual, at this point, the game wasn't necessarily optimized for it. But besides that control issue, perhaps the main problem of this game is as vast as it sometimes seems, you feel so restricted. Though that is the problem of any game which tries to be open world. It has all these buildings, alleyways, and NPCs, but most of it is an illusion, something to be seen but not fully interacted with. But that is a general issue, my specific issue is how the game will have you travel all the way over here, take a train, and continue your journey, only to go back to where you original was. That was annoying as hell and without a quick travel feature, I often found myself more so interested in exploring the sewers or the few buildings I could walk into vs. continuing the story.

But, in general, I wouldnt say there are any real major issues with this game. It did stutter on me sometimes, the load times between locations seemed a bit longer than I would like, and sometimes subtitles didn't show up, but there aren't any major issues.

On The Fence

As many already know, and I mention, part of the games, for a lack of a better term, atmosphere is about the rights of Augs and this has led to many bringing up the Black Lives Matter movement. To me, I would say the issues Augs are facing more correlates to the plight of Muslims across the world. But that little tidbit is an article I haven't the mind to write.

Overall, perhaps what has me feeling this is a rental is that outside of the option to play non-lethal, and the fun hacking mini-game, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided feels like any other open-ended action/adventure/shooter game. Yes, it tries to be political, but that aspect of the game isn't something strongly done. It is like Square-Enix wanted to use those hot topics for advertisement but not for serious exploration. Hence the rental label for while, Im sure, DLC will extend many peoples play times, this just doesnt have the replay value to really put down $60.",Adam Jensen is back and on a new case.

When I heard of the game, I was only going to get Uncharted 3, but the person buying me the game was convinced to get all three in a set. I figured I might as well play them all starting with this one. The game isn't the worst, it's actually pretty good. The locale is beautiful, the missions are fun when you have to scale, jump, solve puzzles et al. Sometimes you have a partner and other times you are alone. You'll really get into searching for Drake's treasure.

However, the wave after wave after wave of bad guys coming after you suck. You scale a wall and there is a gun fight waiting, you open a door and there is a gun fight waiting, you jump down and there is a gun fight waiting. Seriously, How many men do the villains have that are willing to die for them? I guess not many sense they all looked alike. You have the fat gunners, the crazy skinny run around gunners, then the crazy skinny run around gunners in hats. Get bored with them? Now you have camo wearing snipers, and gunners who will kill you in one shot. Bored with them? They will give you something else to shoot. There were villains in places that made no sense for them to be. For example, Nate has the map that the bad guys want, he solves a puzzle which opens a vault or door that hasn't been opened in centuries. but guess who is already inside? You guessed it, the bad guys with guns ready to give you yet ANOTHER gun fight. Since they seem to know the entire route to the treasure, even into sealed off passages it makes you wonder why they want the map so much or why they kept certain people alive to find it. They were already waiting, set up and everything in every place Nate entered. Honestly, I had to roll my eyes at the ridiculous amount of gun fights waiting for me and times I had to shoot someone before they died. I even got a few head shots that weren't even accounted for and had to shoot them several more times before they fell. I can get shooting the camo wearing guys multiple times (They were probably wearing vests), but not the guys wearing dirty t-shirts and nothing else.

Don't get me wrong, this is a fun game.  It is easy to control, run around and mash on the buttons to defeat enemies.  However, after a while it gets very stale.

There is very little variety in terms of scenery and enemies.  This is further reinforced by whatever fighting style you employ.  Once you figure out what works for you, you are almost invincible.  My character had certain buffs that almost guaranteed him full health in most battles, and I would find myself running around to get enemies to chase me and gather them together to kill for combos and extra experience.  Imagine doing this a thousand times and you have finished the game.

The game is just too easy.  The highest difficulty you can start your first game at is ""Expert"" and I would describe as Easy/Normal on other games.  Do not start a ""Normal"" game unless you are new to video games or 7 years old.

The game is also mis-rated in my opinion.  It is cartoon violence and I haven't heard any language.  This is more of a teen rated game.  Yes there is blood and such, but the characters look like cartoons and doesn't seem bad compared to many other M rated games.  I would let a 10-12 yo play this personally without hesitation.  However, I am uncertain of the online component and chatting so that may be reason, but usually online interactions are noted as separate.

Featuring one of the best and most compelling stories you may ever find in a video game period, Force Unleashed also features some thrilling and jaw dropping moments that will make even the smallest Star Wars fan squeal with joy.  You play as Starkiller, the secret apprentice to Darth Vader, and you are charged with eliminating the last remaining Jedi in the universe.

As said before, Force Unleashed is loaded with thrilling moments, but a good amount of these moments are few and far between, and some technical and gameplay glitches really hurt the game as well.  Including times when the camera seems to want to work against you, the targeting system is frustrating in nearly every sense of the word.  The Wii-specific controls take advantage of the Wii-mote and nunchuk, and sometimes work out well, and sometimes prove unresponsive and hard on your wrists.

Still though, the game looks decent, the music is superb, and the art design is great as well.

Will and Ava scramble to escape the nightmare back to where they only have to worry about Nazi's, when Ava drags Will into the war kicking and screaming. My advice to Will is that there are other women who won't try to drag you into a pan dimensional conflict. Nikolai Tesla also makes an even more stapled on appearance, because everyone knows he vanished into the Triangle for a portion of his life.

Graphics are okay, but I wish that the designers had stuck with a theme. If you're a snake, you make things like snakes, and most of the Watchers are snakes. Snake tanks, flying snake guards, snake-ish looking turrets. But then they threw in generic humanoid looking cannon fodder grunts, and I could almost hear the designer whining in the background that snake movements were too hard to design.

Audio is tolerable, though the alien voices are not. Playing english slowed to 1/16th speed is not innovative or creepy, its laughable. Spend thirty minutes and come up with a hissy snake language. And aliens do not speak in calm, almost bored English when in combat. The remainder of the speeches are cookie cutter in the extreme, though some decent snappy one liners earn it some leeway.

Most of the gameplay is so bland cliched shooter that its sad. Weapons are like any FPS, that is you're cannibalizing either dead humans AR's or the alien energy weapons. Add in some purchasable upgrades and Gears of War cover-to-cover combat to season. The distinguishing feature of this was supposed to be the flight pack. And this was almost nauseating, and not to say its bad. But to survive the flight portion requires so many flips and aerial acrobatics that I frequently became disoriented and nearly, well, nauseous. The ""vertical combat"" that's espoused on the box is a nice innovation, but it becomes tedious and worn out by iteration 3, and is vestigial to the point that even the enemies don't seem to care if you ignore them entirely.

So is Dark Void worth it? A solid shooter that has some decent gameplay innovations, its still severely crippled by weak characters and story, and the repetition starts to sink in deep before the end of the first chapter.

The Bad: Bad physics, stiff sluggish controls, bad combat, driving shouldn't be annoying, some puzzles are badly set up

I was so excited for Alone in the Dark for such a long time that I never thought it would be an (almost) bad game. I don't want to rag on this game since the developers did try really hard, so as a courtesy I'm going to start with the positives. The first thing you'll notice are the visuals; they are amazing. The graphics have high res textures, amazing lighting effects, creepy fog, and it's all very dark and surreal. You'll be playing as John Carnby who is trying to find out the secrets of Central Park while trying to stop Lucifer from taking over the world through ""The Path of Light"".

In the beginning of the game everything is very cinematic and pretty fun. The game walks you through the ""mixing system"" where you look in your jacket and mix tons of things together at your will. If you want a molatov cocktail stick a handkerchief in a glass or plastic bottle, light it with a lighter and BOOM! Hey you want it to stick to solve a puzzle? Add some sticky tape and your good to go. Need to light your way through a dark tunnel but need it landed in one precise area without it bouncing? Add some tape to that, or you just take an explosive bottle and shoot it in mid-air...don't worry the John keeps track of the bottle in slow motion it's just your job to time the shot.

There are also environmental weapons such as setting 4x4s on fire and lighting enemies up with them, use them to light your path, take fire extinguishers to put out fire, or you can use them as battering rams to take down doors. While the combination system is really fun it does have it's limits, but we'll get to the down sides later. The next thing you'll come across will be the combat and there are more downs than ups too this. The one good part is you can use anything at your disposal. While you can only kill the demons (they are pretty damn creepy) with fire there are multiple ways to do this. Have a health spray, or any type or aerosol? Use your lighter for a mini flamethrower.

Another great aspect of the game is everything is seen visually. There are no meters or bars anywhere, so your health is indicated by wounds on John's body. Bleed too much and you get a timer to find some bandages fast. There are also car scenes, and Central Park is kind of a much Grand Theft Auto type map where you can get in and out of random cars to kill ""evil roots"" which are a huge pain in the you know what to find, but more on that later. What's really cool is that if there are no keys you can hotwire the car to start it by matching colored wires, so this gives the game a more of a ""I gotta hurry and get the hell out of here"" type feeling. While these are the main elements of the game there are just way too many down sides.

The physics in the game are busted so everything is either really floaty, really heavy, or just plain wonky looking. Nothing really moves around right in the game and this really sucks since a lot of the game is built around physics. When it comes to combat the game just wants to hate you. While there are very little supplies in the game to begin with it's so hard to kill 8 demons when you only have one spray can. While you can only kill with fire is really dumb since you have a gun, but it won't kill them unless you poor gasoline on the bullets. I found this really stupid and when you try to kill the evil roots near the end of the game you will go mad trying to use the little supplies you have for the root, yet trying to fend off the demons.

The controls are just really wonky and don't really work. In third person you can only move with the left stick and you swing things around with the right, but the movement is just really limited. This really sucks when an enemy is behind you and you have to fiddle with the left stick to get John to turn around. The driving is also another pain since the physics really suck. You'll stuck on the slightest slope or little rock and your car will go flying. Demons can come rip you or of your car...or rip the car off you and it's really hard to shake them off. Thanks to the crappy physics you just slightly bump something they go flying off yet they can jump 400 feet. T

he controls just feel stiff and sluggish and they aren't very responsive sometimes, so this makes everything overall harder than it should be. At least the last positive is the voice acting is good, the story is great, and the DVD type skip feature really helps. I can't recommend this game unless you feel like struggling through this annoying game.

But the gameplay for this game is far to realistic and I don't mean that in a good way or a bad way. First of all the game does a great job of taking you into the experience because its first person and its constantly keeping on the edge of your seat with its horrific scenarios and how the player can sometimes see danger coming towards them is a neat feature and adds to the whole horror aspect. But the game starts off slow and only gets exciting when your solving puzzles or have a gun in your hand and shooting enemies and or running from them which might I add one of the most frightening moments in the game.
The game goes for the realism route and that's where the problems come into play first of which is the sneaking which is not that good the whole stealth mechanic is not that good because the game feels it has to be realistic by not giving you mini map or any indication of where the enemies are or how far their range of view is. So the stealth usually end up being long sessions of trial and error. And your most likely won't finish a level that requires stealth without a few retries. Now another problem with this game is the healing system,when you heal you'll automatically kneel down and start to actually ""use"" the med kit which takes a few second or longer depending on how hurt you are but if an enemy hits you during this process you'll automatically die.

I've been using the controller for some time now and it still works fine. I have used it for over 40 hours and the battery still seems to be working fine. So, the battery life is as good as advertised, perhaps even better. The controller is in good condition and there is no significant ""dead-zone"" in the analog sticks and the buttons are just like when they were new. Construction and durability is definitely great as well. I only have one complaint I have noticed though. Whenever I have this controller's receiver plugged into my computer, it boots up slower. After the computer does the POST boot up test and beeps, it hangs and waits about 20 seconds before proceeding. I looked at the LED boot code on my motherboard during this delay and it said the USB controller was being initialized. So, whenever I have this plugged in, it takes the computer a bit longer to start up. This is a huge con for me as I like to have a fast and snappy startup. My solution is just to leave it unplugged until I start using it. I guess the reciever has a large power draw and slows the bootup or maybe my motherboard thinks that the receiver is for a keyboard and tries to set it up to control the computer which doesn't work. I'm not exactly sure why. (For tech people: My computer is self-built and has an EVGA x58 motherboard using AwardBios with an i7 920 processor. Maybe that info will be useful)

REVIEW:

This controller by far is the best controller for the PC. The ergonomics of the button layout and the precision of the analog sticks and buttons are fantastic. The large number of games with built in 360 controller support/profiles make it a desirable choice, especially when considering the versatility to use the same controller on an Xbox 360 console.

I have tried it on multiple games such as Team Fortress 2, The Last Remnant, Dirt 2, Assassin's Creed, and more. The controller works flawlessly with no input lag or incorrect button presses. I have even used programs such as Xpadder and Dolphin Emulator with the controller to test it out and it performs perfectly. One of the greatest strengths about this controller is that many games have already created profiles for the controller. With my old logitech rumple pad 2, I would have to manually create a profile and would often change buttons around to try and find what feels ""right"". With this controller, the guesswork is eliminated in most games and all games will recognize the controller. Some games

Another huge positive is the ability to connect multiple controllers to one receiver. I have played multiplayer games with many controllers hooked up to the same receiver and had no trouble. The receiver is able to differentiate the button presses of the different controllers and everything works out smoothly. Also, you can go and hook up these controllers to an xbox 360 after if you need to and they will work just as a regular 360 wireless controller would. (I had some friends bring over their wireless 360 controllers. We paired them to my receiver and then they later took them back home and reconnected them with their 360s.)

You get a pack of two duracell AA batteries, the controller, instruction manuals, drivers CD, and wireless receiver. Unlike what others have said about having to go to Microsoft's website to get the drivers, I merely ran the CD and followed the onscreen instruction and my controller was set up in under 5 minutes. (I am using Windows 7 64 bit). The receiver is able to work through obstacles; currently, mine is behind my wooden computer desk and it still works fine. The software also comes with a widget-like program for the desktop that shows the number of controllers connected and help files. I find it largely useless, however, maybe you will like it.

Many reviewers seem to be complaining about the power draw of the receiver being too high and being unable to boot up with the receiver plugged in. I feel no such problems on my computer and I leave my receiver plugged in 24/7 along with 9 other USB devices such as 2 hard drives, 2 printers, gaming mouse and keyboard, and more. I don't think the power draw from the receiver is anything to be concerned about. However, I do have a semi-powerful power supply (800watts). Also, the green light on the receiver is bright enough to see and not bright enough to disturb your slumber if you sleep in the same room as you computer. Some people complain about a fuse blowing in the receiver. I have not faced any issue like that, and even if it does happen, I can simply purchase a new receiver for about $10 online and pair my controller to the new receiver.

CONS:
The only thing that I can even say is a negative for this amazing controller is a lack of a dedicated off button. From what I understand, on the Xbox, you would hold down the center Xbox button and press turn off controller. On the pc however, this button does not function the same way. Every time I am done playing, I have to manually remove the battery pack and put it back in. This only takes about 15 seconds to do, however, it would be nice if there was a safer and ""official"" way to do this. Since this version is specifically targeted at PCs, there should be some sort of off button made available. Or the drivers should allow the long press of the xbox button to pull up a menu similar to the 360's, so that the controller can be turned off. Not a big deal.

Also, the use of actual batteries is a bit disappointing. In this age, it would be much more preferable to have a standard rechargeable battery pack. The good thing is that that there are a plethora of cheap 3rd party rechargeable battery packs. The bad news is that they cost money. The controller comes with two duracell batteries which lasted me over the advertised 40 hours.

3.0,False,"07 11, 2013",A355YWQ2CWZTZ3,B000P46NMK,Bowman373,"STORY:

The modern-day events of this game take place immediately after the end of Revelations. For the majority of the game, you play as Connor, a Native American Assassin who fights in the American Revolution. It's very cool to interact and see famous historical figures of the time, and if you're a history buff like me, you'll love the story of Connor. You also play a small portion of the game as Haytham Kenway, Connor's British father. His section of the game is especially interesting, as Haytham was a cool, likable character. Connor, however, was not as good of a character. He's very bland and dull most of the time, not having much of a personality. He's fine to play as, but it's ultimately the supporting characters who carry the story of the game. Unfortunately, you're forced to play as Desmond a few times during the game. I've never really liked Desmond or his story all that much, and I loved the way that they did it in Revelations. His gameplay was completely optional, but if you liked Desmond and wanted to invest some more of your time into his story, then you could. In this game, however, it is not the case. You're forced out of the Animus to play as Desmond at some points in the story, and while these mandatory missions, while brief, are a very annoying pause in the engaging story of Revolutionary America. Unfortunately, the ending absolutely stinks in this game. It was just so abrupt! and it wasn't a cliffhanger-level abrupt like in the past games: the story of Desmond Miles, who we've been playing as since the very first game in the series, has an absolutely awful ending. This, combined with many other flawed aspects of the game, makes me believe that the game was extremely rushed. Like I said in the title, Ubisoft could have made this game a whole lot better, but they rushed it out and it was very disappointing.

GAMEPLAY:

The gameplay in the game is much different from the previous games, and the changes are a really mixed bag. Some of the new additions, such as hunting or trading on the Homestead, are useful, but the past games' versions of these were much better. Ubisoft tried to fix many things that were fine in the first place, such as renovating shops and collecting your income from the bank. Combat has been simplified a lot more, and some strategy is required for some enemy types (this prevents you from counter-spamming every single enemy in the game). While it's very fun and much simpler to do, the other games just seemed to do it better. Switching weapons is very annoying here. The other games got it perfectly! Here, you're taken to a huge menu where you have to scroll through many items to select your weapons. This can be extremely frustrating if you're in a tight spot and you need to switch weapons very often, very fast, because the whole menu transition disorients you for a second or two. Notoriety has been changed slightly as well, now being represented in three levels rather than one percentage. You can travel to four main zones in the game, although you'll only really be spending a lot of time outside of main missions in one or two. There are many annoying bugs with the game, and these can be really frustrating. Sometimes, even when your Notoriety level is incognito, guards will randomly come attack you while you're on your way to a mission. It's easy to deal with the initial 4 or 5 that come charging at you, but you can be stalled up to about 20 minutes because wave after wave of guards just come out of nowhere after you eliminate one. This is good if you just want to slaughter guards, but when you're simply traversing the city or on your way to a mission, it can be very frustrating. For the most part, the game world looks great, but there are MANY graphical errors and bugs. Most of the time, these aren't game-breaking, but sometimes it's annoying when your objective is to follow someone and then have them stand completely still for five minutes. While for the most part, the majority of missions in the game are good, many of them just aren't that good. There are too many tailing missions, and it can be frustrating to do them when your target is moving very slowly. Some of the mission constraints are near-impossible, and some of them were just bad level design rather than an actual challenge. It's also frustrating when you spend many hours crafting the best weapon in the game and then not being allowed to use it because the optional objective says otherwise. A lot of the missions don't require much strategy at all, just memorization of a specific route to take. This can be very annoying, because in some missions there's 1 or 2 ways to do it right an a million ways to do it wrong and fail. Naval combat, however, is probably one of, if not the, strongest aspect of the game. You can purchase upgrades for your ship, select missions, and look for treasure in the Caribbean. The combat itself is extremely simple and fun, and I'm glad that Ubisoft is incorporating it much more into the next game. The free-running in the game, while made simpler and faster, is also very flawed. Sure, it can't be absolutely perfect all the time, but it's very annoying when you're trying to scale a large building and then you jump off because you were holding the stick in the wrong direction.

OVERALL:

While this game had the potential to be an awesome game, it fell very short of most fans' expectations. Most of the side missions are really pointless and boring, and they didn't add anything at all to the game. While the supporting cast of characters was very interesting, our main protagonist is nowhere near as likable or interesting as Ezio and Altair. Many missions are flawed and/or tedious, and Desmond's sections are just frustrating. The story is great for the most part, but the ending completely ruins it. In the end, I feel like this game was very rushed. If Ubisoft had waited a few months, maybe a year, to release the game, then it could've been much, MUCH better. I still recommend this to fans of the Assassin's Creed series, but it isn't even nearly as good as the previous installments.","It had great potential, but ultimately fell very short.",1373500800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

When did KQ become Lara Croft?? Though Roberta Williams did not call this #8 in the series in an attempt to not betray the fans, it has become known as such, but it doesn't matter. KQ is definitely ended here and with good reason. It is a weak, straggling story, badly constructed and throwing away many a good chance. The entire premise is too thin, the puzzles too slight, the construction and animation too crude, the music too dull and uninspired (though it has a couple nice tracks).

For years we were taught to solve puzzles through non-violent solutions, and resort to violence only when necessary. This game flies in the face of the established vogue and is a total disappointment. It's really a shame that what became the last of the series was the last because it wasn't true to form. The puzzles consist mostly of ""look at the object and then figure out how to manipulate"". The hero instantly resorts to theivery, justifies it and doesn't develop at all. He doesn't even have an ending; when the story is over, there is no ending where everything gets tied up and we talk about what it meant. It just ...ends, like an antique video game. As if the programmers didn't give this any thought. What becomes of Connor? Of Sarah? Of anyone? We don't know.

With their corny cliches of hip hop style music with annoying evil laughs, and the stereotype that only men would be playing the game.  At least give us the option of making the group of pixelated 8 bit women go away.  Most of the game makers, at this point had discovered that women like to play the racing games too, and not just the games ending in the word ""Kart"".  So minus a star for that.

Not only are the extra graphics of women unnecessary and poorly made, but they slow the game down, as does a lot of the extra graphics.

3.0,False,"06 28, 2011",A16GGCDUETTTDB,B00149PCAO,T-Man,"Mirror's Edge is one of the most unique games of this gaming generation. As one of its developers noted, too many first-person shooters restrict your movement. You're supposed to save the world, yet you can't jump over a two-foot object?

This game truly took the first-person video game to the next level. And while Bethesda won't admit it, Mirror's Edge served as inspiration for the newly-released ""Brink.""

It feels incredible to do parkour/free-running in this stylish game. The backdrop city setting is beautiful, and its complex parkour controls keeps you almost quite literally on your toes, making it fun and challenging. It is absolutely fun to run and jump off of walls, climb pipes, slide and vault over obstacles. The gun-disarming moves are also really sweet, but of course they require perfect timing, often requiring you to use the slow-motion adrenaline meter. The slow-motion adrenaline meter can also be used to slow down time and make it easier to time your parkour moves.

But on the other hand, there are too many flaws to this game, which are as equally valid to complain about as much as praising the innovative and artistic aspects of the game. While some levels offer you a few paths to get to your objective, there is only one true ""good path"" to take if you're looking to complete the level in the shortest amount of time with the least amount of damage. It is also very trial and error, forcing you to play the same part of the level over and over again until you get it right. This makes it easy even for the most hardcore gamers to get tired of this game. These pre-ordained paths that you MUST take contradict the whole ""freedom of movement"" slogan of the game. It is also damn-near impossible to shoot your way through many parts of the levels where the ability to shoot would be so valuable, especially when ambushed. Most of the time, all you can do is run as fast as you can without flaw, hoping to beat the bad guys to the spot, and then continue to parkour your way through (which is hard enough as it is) until you lose the enemy, hoping that you don't get hit too much. You could use a gun-disarming move (which is also quite hard, even in slow motion), but once you obtain a gun you can only shoot the bad guys blocking your path and when there is no other path that could provide you cover.

And last but not least, there are no experience points or abilities that you earn for Faith, just merely achievements or trophies. Your enemies get stronger, but you will only be left with the same abilities. And when the most elite units ambush you, you have no choice but to run, for they can not only copy your exact parkour techniques, but can also knock you out with a few fancy kicks and punches.

This game was great while it lasted. But I got easily burned out after beating it twice, and that was a very reluctant 2nd time. I usually beat a game 3 or 4 times before getting tired of it. However, there are things they can do to improve any possible sequel.

1. Make it 3rd person, or at least give you a third person option. It is really hard to judge a jump and a wall run when you can't even see your own feet. Besides, I want to see the actual parkour techniques, because it is such a beautiful sport. If you're going to require complex button input, I need to see the body so I can more accurately time my moves.

2. Emphasize the ""shooter"" aspect of the game, like ""Brink"" has done. They could also allow the player to take cover and actually engage in a gun fight. Let the player carry a gun and a few grenades so that they can actually fight bad guys rather than just run.

3. You don't have to make the game completely ""open world"" like Fallout, Assassin's Creed, or Red Dead Redemption. But make it like Hitman. Allow the player to use the ENTIRE level has an obstacle course. Don't let there be only one option, one path. Just tell us the general direction of where we need to go, and give us players the option as to how we will use parkour to reach that place. This will allow us players to explore many different options without having to feel so disappointed by ""trail and error."" We could try so many different options to keep the game interesting.

4. Allow the player to ""upgrade"" the main character so that we can more easily compete with a more challenging environment.

The sensor is a flawless sensor with high, tunable DPI (and a variety of other parameters). A major plus for me is that with the default side grip in place, the sides are tall and flat. This means that I can pretty much use the mouse ambidextrously and always have a nice grip up front for my fourth and fifth fingers. In Sensei-styled mice, this front edge usually tapers and gives me a worse grip. The main part of the mouse is also nice and wide, allowing for my hand to be spread out and reduce cramping. I got the non-aluminum version because I wanted a lower overall weight. But if you like heavier mice, the aluminum version would be the way to go.

It's all true, Guildwars is a beautiful game more along the lines of FF12 graphicly. The characters and the environments are well designed, but the game play is the weak point of guild wars.

 For starters this game is more like an online single player game than an MMO. You of the option of playing with other players but it's not necessary. Most of the time the only reason to be in a guild or to actually need to interact with other players is if you plan on getting involved in pvp. Again it's not at all required in order to beat the game so grouping with other players in combat, joining a guild...it's all up to you.

 The overall game is pretty much an open world. Take some quest do the task and progress in the story. Pretty much like any RPG game just with a larger enviroment, and the option of chosing real players or ai to fight along side with. There are basic henchmen that will be given to you and some that play a larger role. Some have well developed back stories and some have pretty shallow ones (unfortunately Eve as featured on the box art is one of them).

The game with its concept of being non MMO like doesn't force you to grind for armor or weapons. They are pretty much rewarded to you for completing the game and aren't that much different from your base weapons. The problem with this is that while looking special your really just the same as everyone else. It's a good way to balance out the game for pvp reasons but it doesn't give you anything to work hard for and brag about since everyone pretty much has the same thing. Which can be either good or bad personally I'm not into grinding harder than needed so for me it wasn't a bother.

What's unusual about this game is that you don't grind for armor or weapons but instead you grind for skills. Everything is based around skills and putting together the right set. You can only use 8 skilsl at a time and you may have 30+ skills to select from per class. Mostly this part of the game I can do without as it takes the fun out of fighting the way you want to. It's done to make pvp enteresting but really it takes away from it. Some people like this...I however just could not get into it at all. It was a real turnoff for me as most players figured out skill sets that dominate over others it can be difficult to overcome pvp opponents.

All these elements of Guildwars are mixed in over a story format that is semi interesting. It gives you something to keep you going, but not exactly interested enough to see what happens next. Btw you will have to complete these stories to open map areas for new characters that you create which can be fun if you like playing the same game over and over again but, if your like me once is enough.

Overall Guildwars might as well be a single player console game with online co-op play, but it's a computer based game that pretty much serves the same function.

3.0,True,"12 21, 2016",A28ZV1WA9G093H,B01DJPA8WC,TheDave,"I'm a longtime fan of the series, and I have massively enjoyed what I've played from this game. But it's got flaws, and some of them are glaring. Let's split this up.

The Good

The open-world feel of the first 8 chapters is very Witcher or Dragon-Age. The hunts are fun. The music is good, especially if you're an FF fan (They allow you to play old MP3s of former Final Fantasy games during your quests). The collectibles (fishing, cooking dishes, etc) are pretty good too. Some of the best dialogue of any FF I've played is in this game between the 4 main guys, especially when they're exploring a dungeon.  Summons are cool, even though they're random (and with the requirements for seeing them, only 2 of them really show up often). Driving around and riding chocobos is a blast. Combat is engaging and fun. The best parts of this game are when you're not actively doing the story. I've missed other good bits, but there is plenty of 'good' to make this game worth playing.

The Bad

The 'bad' elements are things I think could have been better but weren't. Most of the side quests are repetitious fetch-questy, go get these frogs or find these dog tags, or take a picture of this or that. The hunts are fun, but so far the only really interesting hunt is the behemoth hunt that was included in the demo. There are a lot of buggy things (i.e. mounting your chocobo or picking up mining/food stuff without jumping up and down 20 times). The most fun parts of the game are when the party also has a girl along (Iris, Aranea). These moments are unfortunately short-lived.

The Ugly

So, for me, Final Fantasy is all about plot and characters. Let's face it, this game has little of either. If you don't watch the Kingsglaive movie and the Brotherhood anime before playing, you will be lost. There is little to no intro, and the game assumes you know what went on. And that doesn't really improve as the game goes on. Character development is poor too. With so much focus on the open world and combat mechanics, character development is mostly left to the imagination. Luna and Noct are supposed to be getting married, we should feel romance/love there, but we really don't. By the end of chapter 7, you are almost rooting for another girl in the story. The major villains of the first half of the game (except for one) are all cast aside and made obsolete with little fanfare and little explanation somewhere around chapter 13. The plot twists with your party members are played down and mostly meaningless. And the ending is (well, controversial. Some like it, some don't. I didn't, I'd rather see them put an alternate ending in at some point.)

This game has an identity crisis too. It starts out very slow and dull, a broken-down car that you have to push down a highway for a little too long. However, by chapter 3 it hits its stride. The first 6-8 chapters are reminiscent of Witcher... main quests are fun, with the open world exploration and hunts being even better. Chapter 9 is maybe the high point of the game, with the most important scenes. Then it gets dull. Chapter 10 is a forced-walk slog through a mine. Chapters 11 and 12 are just train scenes, which you'll be begging to get through quickly. ""Walk around the train until it reaches the platform"". again. yay.

And Chapter 13 is just plain rough. It's like a bad cross between Assassin's Creed and Resident Evil. Big warehouse, forced walking/stealth, long hallways, all alone, with jump scares and zombie-like enemies, all with a creepy narrator talking to you over an intercom telling you how ""weak and helpless"" you are the whole time. Just slayed an Iron giant. weak and helpless. yep. And chapter 14 is just plain incomplete. In fact, everything after Chapter 9 feels like a hack. You can see where they made major cuts to get this game out the door in time for Christmas.

All in all, it's definitely worth playing, but it strays from the Final Fantasy brand pretty hard in some areas. I think if they'd taken another year to develop this game before releasing it, it could have been 50 times better. As it stands, this is what we have, so the review is of the game as-is.","Hopefully not the Final Fantasy, but Definitely Not a Perfect Fantasy",1482278400,3,"{'Edition:': ' Deluxe Edition', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

Crazy Taxi 3 does have nice graphics, as you drive through 3 cities that approximate San Francisco, Las Vegas and New York City. Each city has its own personality, and you get to choose from a handful of taxis (and drivers) for each city.
In essence you grab a fare and have to take the fare to their destination. You rack up cash for doing so and the more fares in a row you can do, the better. There are also an assortment of minigames like 'jump through the flaming hoops' and 'pop the balloons'.
It this had come out say 3 years ago, the driving-whereever-you-want would have been amazing. The fact that you could just cruise the streets, plowing over sidewalks, taking shortcuts and looking at the nice graphics would have been great. Unfortunately for CT3, something else came along - Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto HAS taxi missions, with the same earnings and time limits. But in GTA, that is but one tiny part of a huge gameplay system. And when you don't feel like doing timed missions, you have the luxury of driving anywhere you want, in any car you want, and exploring the world you have.
You can say that GTA3/GTAVC is for the PS2 and Crazy Taxi 3 is for the XBox. But what does that mean? That because they were programming for the XBox, Crazy Taxi 3's developers could only put out 1/20th of the game?  At least if they were going to solely concentrate on taxi-like things, they could have put in more cities, or more taxis, or more missions, or something. But the game comes across as an arcade port (which it was) that didn't have a lot of energy behind it (unfortunately). What they put out as a 'complete game' is something the Grand Theft guys kicked out as a fun little side toy. I am a HUGE HUGE fan of arcade games, and also a HUGE fan of driving games, so I really had high hopes for this. But unfortunately the game turned mindlessly repetitive too quickly.
I'm disappointed that the PS2 has the Vice City/GTA3 shining as their 'driving in a city' showoff and that the XBox can only hold this up as a comparison. It's time for the XBox developers to take the brilliance behind Halo and show us that they CAN have a Vice City like incredible experience on their platform.

So I was reluctant to purchase D3, and wanted to wait till it was $29 bucks or something. Got it anyways on a gift card FTW.

The bad:
* D3 has to have the worst story line I've ever suffered through. While the voice acting is ""ok"", what's being said is so utterly stupid. It's almost like watching some B movie that's trying to be serious. I wanted to like this story line. It's impossible. Listening to it three times already all I want is some setting that allows me to turn it off.
* Always online. Now I've played D3 I understand. Blizzard is greedy and some folks are actually stupid enough to use real money to win this game. Awesome. Thanks for the lag you created designing the game around this greed.
* The game is tailored to make you spend gold/money at the AH. At level 40, the gear dropping for you is 30ish. Anything that drops for you is trash loot compared to what you'll buy in the AH for 1000 g.
* Loot drops. Why does a wooden stump give me an upgrade when those three elite mobs I fought for 5 minutes dropped trash loot?
* Zone size. You can walk around any ""zone"" in less than 5 minutes once cleared. That means it's smaller than my neighborhood. One day maybe we'll play a Blizzard game that doesn't feel claustrophobic. Highly doubtful - they spend all dev time working on RMAH stuff.
*Crafting - Why does a boar drop better gear than I can craft? Does Blizzard ever get tired of boars? I'm really &*#&%$ tired of seeing armored boars in Blizzard games. What do these boars eat to become powerful enough to drop yellow loot?

The good:
* It's mindless fun. I can't stress ""mindless"" enough. There's no thinking involved, just click and dodge. Don't spend more than 10 seconds analyzing gear, just vendor it and go to the gold AH.

Conclusion:
Buy it if you like mindless grinds, but don't take D3 seriously and certainly don't torture yourself with money generating Inferno mode. It's maybe a little better than Torchlight 1, but I don't think it's a good as Titan Quest.

The leveling through new content is fun, gone are the ""hubs"" from the last Xpac, there is an actual new continent to explore with many new factions, races and lore.
When you reach the level cap of 90 you can fly in the new areas, until then you are restricted to ground mounts, this forces you to explore and deal with the new terrain and prevents you from grabbing too much to start. The real job starts at 90...
If you want 'epic' gear (purple) you will have to make friends with the new factions, run 'dailys' and collect ""valor"" points to spend on gear. You earn VP pts by doing these dailys (repeatable daily quests) and dungeons, you need to be ""revered"" with the faction before you can buy the gear that faction offers... so if you need a chest, pants, head, etc, you earn the right to each.
The reason you need to earn the gear from factions is to raise your ""iLevel"", the level of your gear, you must have a high ilevel to enter a raid and earn the real epics, the ones you need to beat the highest rated content.
What this means is if you want to raid, you Must do the dailys, this has many upset, the dailys can take hours, even if you take on half of them you will spend hours, leaving all the rest of fun stuff on the back shelf. These daily quests are very repetitive and after awhile you can do them with your eyes closed (not really, but it feels like it, LOL), this is a daily ""Groundhog Day"" experience. If you plan to raid, plan to have long reputation grinds to even enter a raid, this is a huge barrier to those who were used to running dungeons to gear up, since the gear from them is all ""rare"", not epic (blue vs purple) and will not get you to an ilevel high enough for a raid.

If you don't plan to raid, then the game opens up with so much to do, so much to see and so many items to collect that can be fun... pets, mounts, rare items from hard to find NPC's (non-player characters), you can visit all the new shrines and earn a flying disc, you can enter the world of Player vs Player (PVP) and fight other players, just to name a few.
The new area is filled with rare spawns, Very hard to kill 'elite' monsters that will drop rare items, each having special attacks and loot. You can hardly explore without seeing a few along the way, but beware, these are not like the older 'rares', these fight back, these Will kill you if you don't pay attention to the patterns of attack.

To sum up my opinion here..
If you are a raider in WoW be prepared to grind dailys... a lot, this can be seen as unfair, but it's a fact,

If you are an explorer, loremaster, collector of rare items, and casual player the dailys are there, but just running the 'normal' quests in each of the new provinces can keep you busy way past your $50 bucks worth. The lore is outstanding, the rewards for exploring can be great and there are 'scenarios"" that you can run for fun and loot.
This is a fun expansion, but the harsh critics do have a point, raiding has been at the heart of WoW since 'vanilla' and to make it so inaccessible to them without long, boring reputation grinds is unfair. No game should force you to suffer through something you don't like to play something you do, give them multiple paths, give them a 'raiding' path to raiding, not a groundhog grind of epic proportions.

It is an open-ended space sim with a SP plot line, but from all appearances, the player isn't dependent on plot advancement in order to purchase upgrade the ship, weapons, etc. (one of the biggest failings of Freelancer & I-War II).

What has turned me off of this game so far is the speed.  I was looking for something much more fast-paced, and this game just isn't.  The first mission introduces you to combat, but after that, I wanted to upgrade my ship, but got extremely bored trying to get into the trading system and spending so much time flying from system to system.

While the flight engine is pretty good, the weapons were lacking (the starting weapons, anyway).  They ran out of energy very quickly, repeatedly leaving me dodging offensive fire waiting for the guns to recharge so I could get a shot in.

I also found the user interface to be rather clunky and not really user-friendly.

There are some modding and scripting options out there, but I haven't had much success using them - I'm not into programming, so I don't write my own mods or scripts, and I found the X3 script editor to be confusing, and I have yet to find out how to run a script in-game.

Mafia II takes place in the late 1940's in to the 1950's with the gamer playing the character of Vito. Vito returns home from World War II to find his family deeply in debt and himself without a job. So, under the advice of his buddy Joe Barbaro, Vito joins up with one of the mob families in Empire Bay (modeled on New York City and seemingly parts of Chicago too) in order to earn enough cash to pay his family's debts.

The rest of the game consists of basically the same types of killing/robbing/chasing missions gamers have become familiar with during the Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row games as well as the original Mafia game. There's not really anything new in terms of game play. The graphics are good and the cars are pretty accurately modeled on their real life 1950's counterparts. Some of the cars handle horribly in high speed chases so you'll need to learn which car to heist if you need to get away from the cops quickly and effectively.

I didn't enjoy this game as much because after about half of the game I just got tired of so much driving. The world isn't as big as Liberty City but it felt like I was always driving halfway across the city for each mission. The fact that by halfway through the game I just didn't like Vito any more didn't help matters either. Also, don't expect to be able to do much in the game world other than the story missions. Most of the buildings aren't interactive like they are in Liberty City.  Lastly, the ending of the game is really poor. There just didn't feel like any closure to Vito's story at all.

If you like GTA/Saints Row type games, or if you played the original Mafia and liked it, you'll probably like this game too. Because there aren't any side quests or any real reason to even go in to the few buildings that you can go in to, I finished the game in about 12 hours.",Too much driving!,1288656000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

He has returned to the family castle after an absence of twelve years to attend the funeral of his grandfather, William, dead under mysterious circumstances.  As Samuel investigates William's death he begins to uncover hidden family history.  It's up to him to find the truth and break the curse that has burdened his family for generations.
_Black Mirror_ is a mix of the good, bad, and indifferent of Adventure games.  First the good:  The graphics and sound are lovely, particularly the atmospheric effects. The storm sequences were so realistic that I at one point refused to let my cat out because of the weather, eventhough it was dry outside.  The leaves on the trees are articulate, moths flutter around lanterns at night, water moves realistically.  This was a lovely game to look at, which added to the experience.
And that's a good thing, because the gameplay itself was part of the indifferent.  There was nothing really special, no puzzle that was realy challenging or event that was a stunning twist.  The story progressed about as one would expect.  There were a lot of questions left unanswered and a lot of places where I hoped for more, or for something unusual, that I never got.
The puzzles were mainly a mixture of inventory, conversation and mechanical.  None was particularly hard, especially since there was a great deal of repetition.  I lost count of the number of keys you had to find, and at least 3 separate puzzles had the exact same solution. Sometimes there was a bit of pixel hunting involved.  Also, _Black MIrror_ was fairly  linear, meaning that you had to keep revisting places to see what had changed after you'd had certain conversations.  Sometimes this was taken to extremes:  you'd know what to do but if there was one person you hadn't talked to about it you still couldn't do it.  There was also a lot of random waiting:  people would tell you ""yes, I can help you but come back later.""  And I swear there was nothing you actually had to do before ""later"" arrived but wander around and keep asking over and over.
Which brings us to the bad.  The ending of this game was truly awful, I think about the worst ending in game history.  It didn't make any sense and there were so many loose ends that didn't get tied up that I felt like I'd missed about half the game.  It was as if the game developers just got tired and quit. Or maybe they took a break meaning to come back to it later and just forgot.  It put an incredibly bad taste in my mouth.
I also did not find the game as advertised as far as the psychological exloration and thrill factor.  It was quite plodding at times and many things were neither as frightening nor as challenging as they could have been.  Aside from some gore, this title does not merit a horror rating.
_Back Mirror_ was quite long, about 35 hours.  There were a few stumpers, mostly due to pixel hunting--nothing that needed a walkthrough or hint, if you were willing to be patient.  If the ending had been better, I would have considered this a great game and a good value.  However, I was left very disappointed.

IN SUMMARY:
-Great voice acting
-Good city navigation
-Some fun fights

-Deceptive about open endedness
-Bad control scheme
-Simplistic storyline that rags on most western religions
-Deceptive about AI, it's very simple and scripted
-No destructible environments.
-Unusually high system requirements

Pros:
-Building climbing is fairly fun,
-Some swordfights are movielike,
-Voice acting is great!
-His 'jump shank' attack is just ridiculously awesome.

Cons:
-This isn't nearly as open as it says it is, the game is entirely scripted with no chance of random, interesting things happening. The game description leads you to believe otherwise. The scripting is fairly decent though, so only -1/2
-The controls are console-ified, meaning you 'lock on' and 'fire'. This would be tolerable and only a half star off, but the lock on system is moody at best when you need it. -1
-The storyline is very stereotypical. Without spoiling it, it throws mud at every religion to the point they felt they had to have a disclaimer in the game. (no deduction for this)
-The AI isn't half as good as they say.
-The enemies respawn. -1
-Despite having no physics, scripted paths for all AI (try kicking 'em down a ladder, they come right back up for more) and only 110 maximum NPCs on screen at a time, this game requires a dual core processor. This is due entirely to sloppy programming and lack of scalability. If crysis can run on a single core, then this should too. -whatever's left

All in all, this game lasted me 15 hours over a week, most of it done while watching TV. It simply does not live up to the legacy that other PC games set, one of excellent developer content and easy user extensibility.

3.0,False,"01 7, 2010",A1ZCFM6XK8WBE0,B001TOQ8T8,JustinHemenway,"The PS3's LittleBigPlanet was a game about unbridled creativity. Anything was possible, so long as you had the patience to glue it all together. LBP's younger brother for the PSP shares its title but is too often about compromise. While the charm, intricate level design and adorable Sackboys have survived the transition, much of what made the original special has been sent to the scrapheap.

LBP is a classic case of ""can we/should we."" From a technical standpoint, the game is a marvel. Just in case you're not up to speed on the PS3 predecessor - something you need to rectify immediately - LBP is a sidescrolling platformer that allows users to create their own levels from scratch and upload them online. Everything is customizable, from motion-sensing switches to lighting effects to enemy movement patterns. The PSP edition retains this exhaustive level editor and bustling online community. You can download user-made levels on the go, and for that alone, the guys at Studio Cambridge should be patted on the back. I just wish these new worlds had some texture.

More than a year after its release, LBP for the PS3 still pops off the screen. Everything looks and ""feels"" like its real-life equivalent. Sponges, wood, fruits and other inanimate objects all have the right textures, making it seem as if they were cobbled together to form the ultimate block fort. In other words, the presentation is integral to the experience. I understand that this would be asking too much of the PSP LBP, but the bland presentation is still a letdown. Where once there was the grain of wood and the slick sheen of glass there is now just flat, dull colors. Decals and knickknacks help, but the vibrancy of the source material is lost.

It also hurts that you can't rope in some buddies to ""help"" you complete the game. Multiplayer has been cut from the game completely, and while you can still share scores online, the world feels a little sparse without a few companions around to obnoxiously pull you into spiky pits.

Luckily, while Studio Cambridge's levels lack visual punch and team spirit, they're nearly as inventive as the original PS3 batch. They're inspired by world cultures ranging from the Australian Outback to a Hollywood set, and there are enough clever gimmicks packed into each to keep things interesting. Some levels feature a few too many fetch quests - dragging oil barrels in a desert oasis comes to mind - but you're guaranteed to find a few favorites.

Along the way, you may stumble a bit more often than what you're used to, as the LBP games feature multiple planes and floaty physics. Those problems are compounded with the smaller screen size. You'll find yourself getting your Sackfeet stuck in the environment because its harder to discern what's in the foreground and background. Thank goodness that the third plane was dropped.

Of course, the pack-in levels are well-designed and intricate, but what will ultimately determine whether or not this handheld DIY platformer retains its spot on my memory card is the online community. Amateur level designers have been entertaining me on the PS3 since last fall, but here...the jury's still out. All the tools are there, and I've already found winners, but few stand up well to the Cambridge creations. I'm also hoping that we see some of the console DLC that could add even more tools to the box - the paintball gun, water and dozens of new surfaces.

I'm a big fan of the franchise but torn on this particular entry. It's still cute, it's still ingenious and it's still fun, but the magic isn't quite there. The game is absolutely worth it if you don't own a PS3 or just can't get enough of the original (like me), but for everyone else, I suggest saving your money for the Pirates of the Caribbean pack and other add-ons for the big boy version.

At first, you will be thrown off by the slow backswing of your bowler, but if you disregard it, and throw the ball like you normally would, things will be just fine.  After all, bowling is about making the same throw every time, and adjusting where you stand, not adjusting your throw, per se.

You will become accustomed to the difference in style (compared to Wii Sports bowling) after a few games.  Be patient and you will find this game can be just as addicting.  One of the main differences in style is the addition of oil conditions on the lane.  You will definitely notice that the ball reacts differently in the areas that are well oiled.  You can also have two balls at your disposal, like in real bowling, where you would like a strike ball and a spare ball.

The career mode is set up of several `League Nights' in which you bowl 3 games against an opponent.  Win 2 or more, and you will build up stats, but no money.  In fact it costs money to participate in league nights.  Eventually, you will get to a tournament, in which you can win some big cash.  These comprise of 5-6 games, if you plan to win.  There are also major championships.  The career mode seems pretty well laid out in scheduling matters.  I wish it was a little easier to make money along the way.

Yes, it is very slow to make money and there isn't a ton of stuff to buy.  By the time you make enough money to buy anything, you'll question whether you'll want to change your entire style to adjust for the increased hook of the new ball.  That's where practice mode comes into play.  I bowled 6 sets of 3 games before I made it to a tournament in which I made any money.

Brunswick Pro Bowling keeps track of a good amount of stats, including your average, high score, # of strikes, spares, turkeys, etc.

One thing I didn't like about multiplayer, is that I couldn't find a way to use a separate controller for each player.  Each player is forced to use the same controller, and that is just plain dumb.  On a controller where it is advised to wear a wrist strap to protect your tv, I don't want to continuously trade off the controller every 30 seconds.  What were they thinking?

Overall the presentation is a bit dry, and the music isn't great at all, but I've yet to play a bowling game with a rock n roll soundtrack anyway.

Those looking for a more in depth bowling game than Wii Sports will find it here, if you show a little patience to get past the presentation differences.

I knew ahead of time that this wasn't an official drive from Microsoft, but with the Xbox One coming out soon and the number of games I've been playing on my 360 diminishing, I decided to save a bit of money and choose one of the 3rd party manufactured drives from Amazon.

My experience with the drive has been mixed; first, the drive's casing doesn't fit as smoothly into my 360.  It's slightly bigger, so I had to use a bit of pressure to slide it in to the slot.  Because of the tight fit, it was also extremely difficult to pull back out of the unit and took quite a bit of force, so much that I think the pull tab doesn't work very well anymore.  The original Microsoft drive is able to install and remove without any issues, so this was a bit bothersome.  The other issue i've noticed, that I attribute to the hard drive, is that it's performance seems to vary.  Some games that i've installed like NBA 2K13 feel like they load slower and stutter on occasion, which leads to some of the announcers voices getting out of sync with the game.  I also noticed quite a few stutters and pauses in the Madden 25 demo.  I'm unsure if this is a hard drive issue, but I did end up cracking open the case and sliding the bare drive into the 360 and it appears to be running better, so it might have been an issue with the hard drive fitting properly in my system that I mentioned before.

Overall, the drive works, i'm back up and running, but the issues I saw do make me think twice about going cheap here.  Others didn't seem to have any issues, so maybe it's just a little bad luck here.","Decent, Cheap Replacement Hard Drive",1376784000,54,,

The parkour element is done really well and fighting was really exciting.  As you play the game you will get experience points and new abilities so you're constantly getting new abilities and the game is slightly changing as you play so it doesn't get too repetitive.

Yet the game still felt too repetitive. After playing it for nearly 10 hours, I was bored with the game. The fighting became kinda boring even though I had new powers, it was the same type of thing, just over, and over again.  This might have to do with the fact that the storyline is pretty much non existent and is told in a somewhat original yet confusing way. This isn't much of a spoiler, but you basically consume people and see their memories. So the story is told in pieces and bits of memories. The problem is, is that none of the memories are really in sequence.  And all these bits and pieces come in 15 second chunks which basically never draws you in.

The game was a lot of fun. I don't deny that at all, but at the end of it I was left not really wanting to play it anymore, and not very satisfied.

But I'm always curious to try other mice and jumped at the opportunity of taking a look at Microsoft's SideWinder series.

On a purely tech level, the SideWinder is pretty nice.  With a high click count (10 million!) and 2000 DPI for tracking purposes, it's a durable, fast mouse that should satisfy gamers everywhere.  I also appreciate the ""on-the-fly"" DPI-switching feature (the three bars down the center).  However, I didn't find the DPI-switching to be as effective as the ones on the Logitech G9 mouse, which offer a few more options in between.  I found myself wanting a setting between the fastest and the mid level once in awhile.  I also wasn't sure how I'd feel about the vertical buttons on the side of the mouse, versus the horizontal, ""slit-type"" buttons on most mice.  I actually liked them better than I thought I would, but it's purely a matter of preference.

The problem I have with the mouse is that I don't find it to be very comfortable.  The way it's designed isn't ergonomically fit for me and I find it sometimes cutting off my circulation, due to the way it fits my hand.  I find my wrist/hand on a slight upward slant that didn't really feel comfortable, especially when you add in the circulation issue.  For this very reason, I probably won't use the mouse as much as I'd like and I definitely prefer the feel of Logitech's G9 instead.

The positives of this game is that it is a great, and very fun arcade style shooter.  It plays just like the Mercenaries bonus game from the last two Resident Evil games on home consoles.  I love the high score and unlockables features.  There are plenty of characters, and once you get into the nitty, gritty of this game, there really is a lot to do.

The negatives are of course the one save feature.  I luckily got a copy of the game where only a small amount of unlockables had been accessed, but I'm sure some people who pick up a used copy aren't so lucky.  This is probably the biggest drawback for me and is something that is very frustrating, that I can't even start over a game I purchased with my money.

Another thing, which isn't as big a deal but is still aggravating, is that that the game is far too short.  There are only 30 or so missions altogether.  It would have been nice to have had levels from past Resident Evils e.g. 1-3 thrown in or something.  Just to flesh things out.  Still, not a huge deal compared to the one save debacle though.

I'd say that if you're lucky and pick this up for $20 like I did, and hope that all the features aren't already unlocked, then go ahead and buy it.  The only other way to delete the save would be with a save game manager which costs about 20 bucks.  I hope nothing like this happens with any game in the near or distant future.","OK.

Is this worth buying for a fan of the series? Probably.
Is it a strong new step to continue the series? Definitely not.

The gameplay for this episode remains very much the same as the previous games. It's something you have to experience for yourself, but it basically involves a lot of dialogue explaining the murder, then you get the chance to try to prove a point with an intuitive Court Record system. It can feel pretty satisfying, and it's an idea I like to see continued in the series. There are some small minigames where you analyze footprints and fingerprints, but these have been largely to impress reviewers who believe that they matter at all. What matters in a game almost entirely based on text...is the story.

I actually have to congratulate Capcom on deciding to change their star series' main character. Many developers, such as Hideo Kojima, might use their one-hit-wonder until he/she is balding and medicated. However, unfortunately many of Apollo's antics make you want for the original Phoenix. For one, he's young. He shows it in his actions, his relative height with the game's prosecutor, and the way everyone seems to treat him as a little boy. (Why hello, little Polly. Would you like a treat?)

Many new characters are introduced for this game, including your assistant Trucy, a prosecutor named Klavier Gavin, and Apollo's mentor, Kristoph Gavin. Personally, I didn't quite like the dynamics of many of these characters; they all seem to be obsessed with one thing, unless it comes to helping you find the murder. Take note of that: The prosecutor HELPS you. And way too many people, to boot. The whole point of the game is that adrenaline rush when you prove a direct lie in the witness' testimony that proves him to be the murderer.
You: ""Now explain that!""
Witness: ""AAAGH! Y-you...you stupid attorney and your evidence!!!""
Prosecutor: ""B-But...your honor, I object! This is...unjust badgering of the witness!""
Judge: ""Wrong, Mr. Prosecutor. This seems quite condemning!""
Assistant: ""Way to go! I hadn't even noticed that!""

Here's how that might go down in Apollo Justice.
Trucy: ""Hey, Apollo. What starts in 'Autops' and ends in '-y report'?""
Apollo: ""Huh?...OH! You're right! OBJECTION! Witness, look at this! It, er...contradicts...""
Klavier: ""I believe Herr Forehead means that it contradicts <this>, ja?""
Judge: ""Could the defense not yell 'objection' so loud?""
Witness: ""Well, it seems like not everything went quite according to plan. Oh well.""

Believe it or not, that last quote is more or less what one of the murderers says when found out. Basically, I felt like the game destroyed your sense of self-satisfaction from solving the case. Also, a few of the murders don't make any sense at all...

During the last case, you do get a chance to play as Phoenix Wright for a short trial, but it just feels a little empty, especially because it ends in the loss of his badge forever.

Those who have played this game before will notice similarities right away. The revamp of the original title music as well as the little egg-headed creatures named nightopians and others that fans of the original will appreciate.

Graphics: The graphics in this game aren't bad but they are colorful in some places and helen looks like a miniature barbie in the face. The cut-scenes in the introduction are well-made in video format. Fans may notice on the Second Door (first level) that the mirrors inside the castle are the same ones used in the museum garden for Helen's dream.

Sound: Revamp of the original music along with new editions is easy on the ears.

Controls: There are three ways to control Nights; Wii Remote, Nunchuck+Wii, or a gamecube controller. Nunchuck+Wii is the easiest configuration to use. The game refers to the wii remote use as 'mind synch' but to simply but it move the remote an inch off of Nights and she/he won't move. I also found the control-scheme for this particularly unresponsive and jerky.

Gameplay: Players are meet with choosing either girl or boy with their respective dream scenes. I was surprise how creepy helen's mom looked as though she was going to jump out the window at any second. After the cut-scene your able to explore around the dream-gate area or synch with nights for a flying tutorial. Rings are collected in each level as score-points and are used to speed night's flight bath. Blue chips are used to get the keys from the birds or as self-defense on foot. Each level is enormous and will change from Nights to on foot, and you'll be para-looping often to collect orbs and enemies. Boss battles consist of timing and good aiming/reflexes to advance to the next stage. Linger around a stage for too long and it's game over.

Wi-Fi: Left my wi-fi on looking for 2p for 15-20 minutes and found no connections at all. On the flip side, by visting my garden I had atleast 4 or 5 connections so far. ""Talking"" is very limited in the game in which players interact with other players by use of symbols and pictures. There is no explanation in the booklet what all the symbols mean which can lead to guessing what another player is trying to say/do. There is no buddy list except by those which you already know, this can be obtained by their game ID number(ex. 400-900-65784). Gardens sadly are also very limited in customization. Objects cannot be moved and things need to be collected in game to use them and with wii weather on changes the sky.

Similarities: The bosses are the same yet they are not. They have been 'replaced' with new editions but the methods of squashing them is the same with new tweaks. Such as the first boss, by ramming into the top of the bosses head and bouncing off causes the enemy to be down-sized, but this time by para-looping particles.

The music has been revamped with old tunes such as 'In The Night' and the loading screen, along with the start menu.

Remember that glowing purple stuff that covered the 'off-limits' part of the games? There is now an explanation for it and a side-effect. No more bouncing off purple stuff and getting stunned so the clock can come. In the game it's explain that it'll immediately wake the person if they touch it, meaning game over.

Some of our favorite bosses/villians are back such as WiseMan and Reela with certain stages. And the egg-headed nightopians are back too.

Differences:
-New Bosses but basicually same methods.
-The addition of the Wi-Fi connection.
-Players choosing several doors in up to 4 stages are needed to complete
-No more Giant Clocks, 'Awakens' are used after the timer is up to capture the players.
-Players have more time on foot than the original.
-New characters with the addition of owl.
-Nightopians and Nightmares could only breed/exist on the stages. Para-looping them meant death but now they are sent to a garden instead.
-Nights can now transform into different items to unlock areas.

Set-Backs:
-Owl's tutorials are annoying once they have been done once. Why do I have to repeat the tutorial? And during the beginning when he was talking about NiGhts seemed to be an inside joke when he made the remark ""if your into that sort of thing"".
-The lack of customization and communication for the garden limits the wi-fi experience. And a 2P that takes forever searching for any other player for 2P.
-Particularly I don't like the way the character designs were for this game. Helen looks like a plastic little barbie and the guy character has been camping out in the woods for too long.
-Sometimes the colors are crayola bright and look poly-gonish, especially during the cut-scenes. Owl is a shinning example of what we call ""texture lazy"".
-NiGHTS is still an 'it' or as reela preferred...perhaps Nights is not an it! Far as I'm concern she's a chick.
-Helen and the Boy's personalities are somewhat cliche.

The basic gameplay is classic Sonic: extremely fast side-scrolling in a 2D environment. The level designs are creative and very colorful. There are other gameplay elements that work well too. The boss battles are a new, refreshing experience and are fun. However, both the side-scrolling and boss battles can get very repetitive. The game also utilizes the touch screen of the DS with the chaos emerald bonus challenges. For the most part it works well, but it seems that the developers just through it in the game to add a touch screen aspect.
Irritating aspects of the game include the music and certain enemy placement. You'll be flying through a level, snagging rings, when BAM! An enemy will appear in your path and you'll have less than a split second to react. This breaks up the pace of certain levels and only acts as an annoyance.
The ability to play as Blaze the Cat adds length and replay value to the game. However, it fails to offer any new features because Blaze's levels are the same as Sonic's.

I mean I loved FNR3 and thought FNR4 wasn't as fun but still passable so this new one should have corrected the mistakes of FNR4, and have improved graphics and mechanics to boot.  Boy, I was wrong.  I'll admit that I didn't finish the game, but that's because the game is punishingly difficult at certain fights.  From the very first bout, I got decked within the first 10 seconds and I thought, this must be part of the tutorial or something...nope, it's just the actual gameplay and I proceeded to get my ass handed to me a couple more times before I got the hang of it.  So with my newly discovered skills, I make it to about 3 or 4 hours into the game (or what seemed like it because it would take me multiple attempts to pass certain fighters), to a fighter down in Mexico who I just couldn't imagine beating so I just gave up and traded it in. I played on normal and it seemed like abnormal because I game quite a bit and consider myself somewhat of a capable gamer, but this one was just painful to play (perhaps a sick, metaphoric joke from the developers of a fighting game).  The reason it's so difficult is because the game tries to make you fight in certain ways during certain fights, e.g., they want you to use hooks during one fight or body blows or whatever they can conjure up, which doesn't sound too bad, but then they intentionally play with your stamina meter so you can't use a consistent style from one fighter to the next.  I was punching away like Pacquiao in some fights without tiring and then in another, I'll throw 3 or 4 punches and tire out for the whole round so I keep backpedaling until I finally get tagged.  This game could have been great if it just kept your fighter consistent throughout.

I've been playing Madden since it came out on the Super Nintendo.  There have been good versions and bad ones.  This is one of the bad ones.  The All-Pro mode is ridiculously hard.  The ""Adaptive Difficulty Engine"" that it proudly trumpets just allows the game to beat you more easily.  I have yet to win a game using the customized skill settings.  Typically, you will get sacked numerous times a game, no matter how good your o-line is, and you will rarely sack the AI player.  Magically, it always seems to happen on 3rd down.  It's not like you are hanging in the pocket all day.  When looking at the replays, you will often see your offensive linemen just step back and allow the defense to come through untouched.  AI Linebackers will out jump wide receivers to make interceptions, even if their back is to the ball. The defensive linemen have the ability to bat down your passes while engaged, you wont. Your fastest wideouts will jog their routes while the AI defensive players will zoom to anywhere on the field as needed.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't want to play defense for 80% of a game.  It's just not fun watching the AI player run through gaping holes in your offense, catch passes in triple coverage, sack you with ease on third down, run a perfect 2 minute offense every time, and always able to out guess your play calling.

Make no mistake: by purely objective standards, the game is still pretty good. Kotaro Uchikoshi's writing is good. The plot arc has internal consistency. The ""fragment"" system, designed to intentionally disorient the player as though they were *also* with the characters, waking and sleeping and never sure what has happened before them.

The big twist/surprise regarding who ""Zero"" is this time, however ... very weak. In many ways they re-used the fourth wall gimmick from a previous entry in the series. They also packed the title with characters from previous entries, some of whom acted nothing like their prequel counterparts (I'm looking at you, Junpei. No one gets that emo in a year.)

The biggest crime ZTD commits, though, is an ending that created more loose ends than it solved. Honestly, it created MORE loose ends than the first game did, and probably about the same amount as the second game. And the sad thing is, it could have. With some time and exposition, with some rounding out of the villain's backstory (hell, I'd even take it as a DLC scenario at this point), they could have. But they didn't.

Instead, it seems Zero Escape is being set up for additional games. A new MacGuffin introduced into the worldlines ... a machine that can be activated once every 10 months wherein you can send up to two humans to any place in time in ANY known worldline/universe ... that's been known about for at least a century ... that's just goofy. It seems the device was created in the game solely for the purpose of setting up [spoiler-ish] two characters becoming parents of two other characters [/spoiler-ish]. But now the developers will have to pay the price for introducing this nonsense.

If this were a standalone title ... it wouldn't make much sense, but it'd still be intriguing. As the third game in an otherwise excellent series, ZTD is a disappointment. Fun to play, but complete letdown of an ending. And ... I haven't even talked about Mira and Eric.

In terms of gameplay, I found it to be better than its predecessors. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is familiar.  The game has greatly improved visually, but still lacks the storyline to really bring this game to life.  I have to admit that after playing Halo 3, I believed that the writers just didn't know any better.  Master Chief is linear in character and lacks any personality that would make him human.  After ODST, I realized that the writers know better.  They took a first step towards bringing characters to life.  Giving me a reason to believe the war is worth fighting.

Reach tries to add more worth to their characters, but never quite makes it.  If you are familiar with the Halo games, then you know Reach falls.  When your audience already knows the ending to the battle, you can't just make a normal Halo storyline.  You need to put in plot twists and urgency that makes the player forget all about what he or she knows about the series.

I may have had expected too much from this game. Overall, I realize I need a strong storyline. Running around and shooting aliens can be fun but doesn't hold my interest over a long period of time.

-Before I Begin...
My review will be spilt up into sections and have a in-depth look at that topic. If you hate reading medium/long reviews or just don't have the patience I would not continue reading, but if you want to learn the most about the product before you buy it you'll continue.

-Interface
The interface is the same as always, point in the direction you want to go in a and click. However, moving around the castle grounds is through a third person view which offsets the whole ""I'm Nancy Drew!"" feel. But don't worry it's only when your outside in the dark so you never see Nancy, just a figure pretty much. What stupifies me is that Nancy talks on her cellphone in the opening scene but she loses it somehow and we have to use a payphone, so there is no cell phone icon in the interface. This interface is great, the only thing that bugged me was the third person affect when outside the Castle of Malloy.
****

-Plot
In this adventure, Nancy is off to Ireland as the maid of honor to Kyler Malloy, who is getting married to Matt Simmons in a couple days. But when Nancy arrives, Kyler says that Matt has vanished! It is up to Nancy Drew to find Matt and save the wedding. The plot is good but they could have emphasized different parts more. Like the fact that Kyler and Kit Foley (Matt's best friend) were a couple before. Sadly, there is very little drama about this love triangle (maybe because all the Nancy Drew games are quite modest). Very little of the castle history is revealed as well. The fact that half the castle is blown to pieces is interesting but not much more information is given on why it is blown up. I think the basics of the plot are there, but more development could have gone into it.
***

-Characters
There are four characters, each with different personalities, in this game. However, since one is missing, there are really only three characters. The character development and interaction was dissapointing. The backgrounds of each character are very briefly revealed and only one character stood out. Your bride to be is Kyler Malloy, who recently found out her family heritage. She is sweet and kind but not much else to her, she believes that Matt's dissapearence is a prank. Then there is Kit Foley, who is Matt's best friend. Kit is in the real estate business, and unfortunately even more boring than Kyler. He doesn't have much personality and simply believes that Matt has walked out on Kyler. Finally there is Donal, an old Irishman who is stubborn and quite a hoot to listen to. He is the caretaker and believes that ""faeries"" have taken Matt because he is not Irish. I would talk about Matt, but you don't see him until the end of the game, which is rather dissapointing. It would have been nice to at least meet Matt in the begining before mysteriously vanishing. Overall, the characters seemed to be irrelevant to the game at all because you hardly talked to them. The game could have been outstanding if they just developed the characters more.
***

-Setting & Graphics
First off, the graphis were amazing. However, everything else was completely wrong. I found it completely crazy that the game took place in ONE NIGHT! I thought Nancy was supposed to be there for a week or so, but no. This time constraint really affected the game. It was so dark and gloomy the whole game that you could not see Ireland's beautiful landscape when outside. There was a lot of places to go, but it was completely barren! The castle had only three rooms for you to explore: the Great room, the Library, and the Nursery. And each of those rooms had very little to read, touch or look at. It would have been nice if Nancy had her own room (It is a castle for heaven's sake! It should be pretty big inside, am I right?), but apparently everyone sleeps in cots in the Great room. Did I mention the Great room has a huge hole in it from the explosion years ago? The outside grounds and the Screaming Banshee Inn are also pretty barren as well. There is virtually nothing to snoop in, no historical documents about the castle, no artwork to admire, nothing. Extremely dissapointing, I would give this section two stars but the graphics are so amazing that it gets that extra star.
***

-Puzzles/Activities
The puzzles were outstanding! Most of the puzzles were original, challenging and thought provoking. This is the highlight of the game. If you liked Crystal Skull's puzzles you'll like these ones a lot. I really enjoyed the fact that there was always something for you to do. If you ever needed a break form the puzzles, you can go to the Inn and play minigames. None of the puzzles were randomly thrown in, they all made sense. There are chores, but you don't have to repeat them everyday (Mainly because the game is all in one night). And the chores are easy, fun, and make sense in the game. Overall, the puzzles made this game, without them, I would not reccomend this game.
*****

-Scare Factor
This is a new section that covers the scariness of the game. The mood was dark and gloomy, and you would always here an erie wailing (from an alleged Banshee). The Nursery in the castle was downright creepy to be in. There were one or two startling moments, especially as the game climaxed. I think the scariness was on a good level, not to scary but not too mild.
****

-Ending
Unfortunatley, the ending was abrupt like some previous games, but what was refreshing was that there was no timed puzzles or racing through mazes. You could take your time at the end, find/question Matt and finish the game peacefully. In fact, the ending puzzles were some of the easiest in the whole game, which was a let down after all you have been doing throughout the game to win. But you might be dissapointed with how Matt vanished, I was pretty dissapointed. Since the plot wasn't brilliantly detailed or anything, the resolution could be explained without leaving any facts or problems hanging in the air.
***

-Overall
I'm not going to lie I did enjoy the game, and I will be seeing myself playing it again and again. But it doesn't give you that ""wow"" factor that Phantom Of Venice gave me. It seemed like it wasn't all the way developed. Potentially, it could have been the best game in the series if they just developed the plot, characters, and setting more. Hardcore Nancy Drew fans may find that something is missing, but there is plenty good in this game to buy it. I would recommend this for its puzzles and its scare factor (Perfect for Halloween night). Nancy's next adventure is Ransom Of The Seven Ships, which includes Bess & George! Sounds promising!

3.0,False,"08 26, 2008",A1KBV71PGFFPVV,B0012N7BSI,D. Bowman,"I bought the Collector's Edition because I thought it was a great deal.
I hadn't played Madden religiously for a few years.

I was ready to dive back in. I wanted the Xbox version, but the friends that would actually
play on-line only owned PS3s. So I gave up the achievement love and got the PS3 version.

I was hesitant because last year's PS3 version ran at a slower frame rate.
I did some quick research and I didn't see reports of any differences this year.

Before I called my buddies up, I wanted to try a quick game. I jumped in and started playing like I never stopped playing. The game played almost exactly the same as 3 years ago. I had to get used to the hit stick and such, but it is still pretty much the exact same game. I'm not sure if I liked being good already, or if I wanted more of a learning curve. It was a little odd.

So I fired the PS3 up and that was when the problems started. The game only plays in 720p. My HDTV in my game room is a 40"" Sony that only displays 1080i, not 720p. I had thought that after the PS3 launch titles made this mistake, EA and Sony would have fixed the issue. Nope. So there I was, stuck playing in 480i in 4:3 mode on my TV. So the graphics were bland and I couldn't play in widescreen so I couldn't see the whole field. My wide out WRs were off screen.

The Xbox version will play in 1080i on my TV just fine.

I still decided to suck it up, because the only reason I got the PS3 version was to play with buddies who lived in other states.

This is where it got horrible.
The PS3 online experience vs. Xbox live is night and day.
The PS3 was horrible.
It took us forever to get a game going. There was some kind of glitch that kept changing both of our playbooks as we started the game to Chicago's playbook. Also, the only way we could start the damn game was to hit the X button exactly at the same time. We had to synchronize our button pushing.

These are the main problems: You can't move while reloading, aiming, or shooting; instead you become rooted to the spot and therefore hopelessly vulnerable to attack. When aiming the sight is often (although, oddly, not always) wrenched away from the point already centred so you have to find your target again. And you can't jump or crouch unless prompted. What the hell is that all about? Also the AI is pretty poor. Sheva gets in the way more often than not. The UI looks like something out of the 90s and is clunky to say the least. And you can't access the inventory during gameplay (although I understand the reasoning behind this it is frustrating at times). So what is there to like? Well it looks amazing. The graphics are among the best I've ever seen, with particularly impressive character models and animations. And, controls aside, the gameplay is enjoyable, with a good selection of environments, some pretty tough bosses, and a range of simple but enjoyable puzzles to solve.

The balance board is great and tracks ever slight shift of weight making it very accurate, even on carpet.  The balance board is decent size for an average person. I am a men's size 10 and if my feet were any bigger, my toes would be hanging off the front. The board could also be a little wider. Too bad they do not have a second, larger version. I do suggest a rechargeable battery set and a silicon sleeve.

The Wii Fit software is great. Sure, you could do exercises the on your own. They are basic like push ups, side twists, and simple yoga moves. Some of the exercises you do not even use the balance board or the Wii remote, which seems kind of cheap and offers no measurement or feedback. What makes using Wii Fit better than just doing the exercises on your own is the balance board. This system is about stabilizing your body. It shows instant feedback on your movement so you can adjust yourself and hold the correct pose. This will help you achieve balance and properly exercise.

That said, there are several annoyances and issues I have with Wii Fit.

1. The fit credits. The credits are given as minutes for each exercise. While sometimes it gives you proper time, like do a 10 minute step it will give :10 minute credit. However for the yoga portion it gives you :02 minutes of credit for everything and some of the poses are only :30 seconds. If you acheived :30 fit credit minutes of yoga you would actually have only done :12 minutes of yoga. This can be very deceiving if you are trying to do :30 minutes a day.

2. Clicking and time between exercises. The BIGGEST FLAW of Wii Fit is the inability to create a work out by automatically ending one exercises and continue to another. You have to select each exercise, complete it, and go back to the main screen and select again. This can be very annoying. What makes it more annoying is the fact that after you complete the exercise you get several screens you must click through. And it is the same message every time. After you complete an exercise you have to click through five to seven screens. It takes about :15 seconds to complete an exercise and return to the screen. May not seem like much but it adds up to 5 minutes if you do just 20 exercises. Worse, it checks your balance before every exercise and if it involves lifting a foot it gives you a warning every time. Before you start an exercise it also takes :15 seconds. There's another 5 minutes for 20 exercise. The end result is a :30 second resting period between and clicking through 8 to 10 screens between every exercise. I have found myself randomly running in place or stretching between exercises just to keep loose and moving.

These first two issues combined make for a long work out. I do one hour and fifteen ""fit credit"" minutes each session, which results in an actual work out time of :45 minutes. To complete this :45 minute work out take a little more than one hour and thirty minutes.

3. Lack of Wii Remote usage. They really missed on some opportunities to use the Wii Remote. There are only about five exercises that actually use the remote. However, there are several that could have easily incorporated the Wii Remote and provided better feedback.

Hopefully there will be a second version of Wii Fit that will allow you to create an work out by simply selecting the exercises you want and allows the next to start after the previous ends. And, utilize the Wii remote more.",A good start but needs improvement -- read this review if you are looking for a quick work out.,1241308800,3,,

The controller itself had the activate button on your middle right finger on the back. See they don't show you any pictures of that because it's a bit weird.

I have a few complaints and I hope you'll reconsider buying this product on an impulse based on its pricing. The price is very low compared to others but the preformanxe needs improving.

When you activate the contrle met LED light flashes super fast! I mean almost uncontrollably fast, so having 27 mods is ridiculous and stupid! I play ghosts with it and that's it. The only mods I use is #3,8,11,and 14.

When you try to shut off the mod portion of the controller by following the instructions it says holding the activate button down until the 4th LED light goes out, it's off but that's a lie. You have to hold it down once the light turns off for over 4 sec. If you do it too short it'll cycle it back on and if you hold it too long it'll still cycle back on.

If you like in-depth mmorpgs, lots of crafting/tradeskills and things of that nature, this game isn't for you.  Basically its a LOT like City of Heroes.  You fight, and fight and fight and fight...and thats about it.  Oh wait, you also can participate in critical missions sponsored by the server when you get to a high level, but you'll be doing nothing but street fighting and missions like you do in city of heroes.

The combat system is good, not AWESOME, but cool.  I prefer wow's combat system with hotkeys for your spells/abilities, but whatever.  This is a different combat system and much cooler than the old pick a spell and watch it happen style that EQ and a lot of others have.  Basically its a super-advanced version of rock/paper/scissors, but not as dull as rock paper scissors :).

The absolute best thing about this game is the fighting animations.  They simply rock.  When you get off a martial arts special move and smack the mob around like a rag doll, you get all giddy inside :).  Unfortunately, thats all you do in this game - fight.

The lag...oh god.  Other than the mind-numbingly boring kill the same guys over and over, you'll pick an ability to use, wait like 5 minutes mashing the key while your character does nothing, and then when the lag bomb goes away, you're dead.  I mean this happens in just about every online game at one point or another (even world of warcraft), but not as often as this game does.  I have a pretty high-end machine and cable internet and it still lags.

Personally, I would not suggest this for anyone.  There are MUCH better games out there.  I just feel bad for die-hard fans of the matrix that went out and got this and realized they wasted their money.

If you want a really good online game, I suggest World of Warcraft.  I wrote a pretty decent review about it.  Another really fun yet simple one (if all you want to do is fight and play every once in a while) - is City of Heroes.  I mean City of Heroes is a lot like this game, just fighting and fighting, but I keep finding myself going back for the cool super powers over and over :)  I played FFXI too long, and it just took too long to get stuff done - so I don't suggest getting that.

Bottom-line, don't get this game, there are so many other good games out there and this one just doesn't cut the mustard.

Successive games brought new quirks to the MP experience but the gameplay essentials remained the same.  The campaign stagnates.  All of the 'twists aren't really twists anymore since we've seen 3arc and Infinity Ward use the same twists over and over again.
I still enjoy the multiplayer.  Mp is a big factor in deciding what games i buy, because it's a way i can keep in touch with friends from far away. Yet, I'm sick of being sold the same game as MW over and over again.  They won't stop making COD because its been very successful at convincing gamers that each installment is different. i popped in MW on my mac the other day...its remarkable how similar the games really are.

Still, its cool that the player can customize his/her load out.
Multiplayer is fun, the league system is fun also, provided you build a team of friends to take on the camping boy scouts of Cod out there. Still, i enjoy the multiplayer.

New format: I can support this new format of contracts being released over time; I don't mind waiting for new cities.  But also included in this new format is an odd requirement of being connected to their servers while playing (i.e. online).  This is, for lack of words, painful.  Mid way through contracts you'll be disconnected from their servers and forced back to the main screen.  For me, I thought I had an issue and went through a network reset [router and modem].  20 minutes later back to the game, same server issue.  Reloaded check point and few minutes later same thing. In fact for the rest of that day I couldn't connect to their servers.  Yes an offline gameplay is available but what you do offline will not unlock in game items/ progression, which means you're confined to the current basic contract terms.  It wasn't until today that I was able to play a compete contract while connected to their servers.

Gameplay: Best way to describe it, it's been Dumbed Down.  The game spoon feeds you everything you need to progress. Simple solution, utlize the settings.  I would enjoy a briefing before the start in the planning option that would hint at different paths to take, instead the game gives you guidance as you play.  This is is not a complaint, just an observation.  The gameplay is fun if you ignore the hand holding.

Graphics: I'm playing on an Xbox One.  I'm a casual enjoyer of games and will never be a PC guy.  I'm happy with the graphics and frame rate.  I have only noticed one distance drawing issue, a computer generated figure was frozen in place and only activated once I came in it's proximity.  This again is just an observation, and I only seen it once.

Overall: I'm happy with the purchase.  Mildly upset with their end due to their servers, and fact everything needs to be done online. I do look forward to contract updates and new cities.

This game is nearly identical to SimCity 3000 for the PC, with only a few minor changes. The graphics look good - nearly identical to the PC version. The music is nice and catchy, and the controls do an excellent job taking advantage of the Nintendo DS's two-screen display and touch screen interface.

Unfortunately, there are a few things about this game that drive me crazy. The biggest problem is that the game requires you to pause your city while making changes (at least as far as I can tell). This setup is very frustrating to me, especially because the time does not change very quickly (there are two speed settings: slow and super slow). Also, in the PC version, you could easily open a box listing all the citizens that want to talk to you, but in this game this same process is much more limited and time consuming.

In this game you don't have to connect your city grid with pipes to implement the water system, which makes things less frustrating. Also, it is simple to create land or water, although all the land in the game is flat (no mountains!).

But there are, unfortunately, some significant problems with the game. Firstly, there's the fact that the GBA has two less buttons than the SNES. The control scheme is customizable, thankfully, but it takes time to get used to it. Finger-cramping is pretty common after playing for a long period of time, even if you're used to playing the GBA for extended sessions.
Another downside is the music. To put it simply, it's bad. We're talking barely Game Boy Color quality here, and it's a real shame. Part of the charm of the SF2 games is the cool music, and unfortunately this aspect did not carry over well to the GBA at all.
And one other gripe - the game can crash. After unlocking Akuma, he can be your opponent in the arcade mode. But unfortunately, the game crashes and burns horribly 9 times out of 10 when it brings me to him in the arcade ladder. A console game crashing under normal usage is a Very Bad Thing(tm), and that's ultimately what brings this game's rating down from 4 stars to 3 stars in my book.
Conclusion: SF2 for GBA is fun, but in many regards it just doesn't do justice to the SNES versions. When you see awesome conversions like Mario Kart Super Circuit, and compare them to this somewhat lacking port of Street Fighter II, its faults can become pretty glaring.","It could be better, but it's still a blast to play",1010880000,9,,
3.0,False,"06 11, 2014",A27Q1LRDZK3C76,B00C1ZBFTW,EpsilonX,"This game was decent.  I'm not going to go into much detail about the game, but I do have a few things to say.  A pros and cons chart seems like the easiest way, so, here it is.

Pros:
- great graphics for the 3DS
- monsters are cool
- press turn battle system (hit a weakness and gain a turn, miss or hit a resistance and lose one)
- soundtrack is awesome
- can revive after losing battles, reducing frustration from having to constantly re-load
- fusing demons is as fun and addicting as ever

Cons:
- dungeons are all pretty same-y.
- battle system is easy to exploit, making battles repetitive and tedious
- far too easy to get lost on the world map

Other (good/bad depending on person):
- tons of grinding
- difficult
- very bare-bones story that exists only to send you out to fight more monsters

Basically, the game is decent.  The simple story (search for somebody, and do quests for people you meet on the way) is enough to give you a reason to fight monsters, but nothing more.  Battles boil down to finding the enemies weakness and using that attack until you win; if you lose, grind a few more levels and try again.  If you're looking for a grind fest, or a game focused more on a traditional turn-based battle system, you might like this.  If you're looking to collect and fuse demons, or are a fan of Shin Megami Tensei games, you'll love this.  If you're looking for a story-driven game like JRPGs are often known for, avoid this.

The game has a lot of good content presentation going though. The way it shows important scenes in ""picture in picture"" boxes makes sense to me even beyond the comic-book look and feel. Some of the gameplay however is pretty unique due to the comic-style presentation. For instance, you can see that guards are about to walk around a corner, because you can see little ""tap tap tap"" indicators on the screen. This adds a nice spin.
So why only 3 stars? Because of the damn save game mechanism. I mean: Why even allow to save anywhere, if you can only start over at the beginning ov levels?!? This completely ruins the game for me.

As far as the main game, I can see all of the Souls comparisons but it was just different enough to not feel like an absolute rip-off.  It's more like a spin-off, kinda.  Not in the true sense of the word (since the stories obviously aren't linked), so maybe it's more like a kid brother to Dark Souls.  It's shorter, it's easier, and it feels less inspired and creative.  It's still more difficult than your average game and has it's own kind of charm.

The main problem I have with the 'Complete Edition' is that the DLC is on a voucher card, instead of being on-disc.  The main game plus the DLC only takes up a bit over 10gb of space so the manufacturers could've easily fit it all on a single blu-ray disc.  The fact that they didn't just makes it feel cheap.  I'm glad the starting price was only $30 but you'd probably be better off just buying the main game and buying the specific DLC that you really want.  As far as the DLC, I wasn't very impressed, at all.  The weapons and upgrade packs barely help out and you really don't even need them to do well.  The main 'mission' DLC is super short (around 30 mins.) and I found the boss to be the only truly annoying boss in the whole game.

Overall, I wish I had just bought the main game for half the price and skipped all of the DLC.  My curiosity and desire for 'more bang for my buck' got the better of me and I feel like I wasted time and money playing and buying the weak extras.  If it was all on-disc, I still would've rather skipped the DLC, but at least I would've felt slightly less cheated.","Decent game, weak/short DLC (on voucher card)",1447286400,37,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

the gameplay itself is average for modern day standard. it's the standard open world sandbox-ish type of FPS. you're given several types of missions you can take one spread across the map. the weapon modification and leveling system is also very basic. it gets annoying after a while that the game requires you to pick herbs constantly to craft med kits.

3.0,False,"05 20, 2010",A2ZFC9T0U6MM6J,B000FQBF1M,Scrutinizer,"As the review title states, I only played the single-player mode, so if you want a review of multiplayer, you will want to check out other reviews.

For me, this game starts with the graphics.  Wow.  Very pretty to look at, it lives up to the hype created back in 2005 when the famous demo was shown at E3.

That said, the great graphics cover up the most generic, mediocre FPS I've yet played this generation.

For a sci-fi game, the weapons are incredibly generic.  Machine guns, shotgun, sniper rifle (which you never really need, but is available), rocket launchers...in some ways, there's no need for this to be a sci-fi game at all.  You do get a lightning gun for half of one level, which is awesome, because it pretty much makes you invincible.  Sadly, at the end of that level, it vanishes for the rest of the game.

I actually did not have problems with the controls, as many have.  It takes some adjusting to if you've played a lot of FPS games, but the learning curve is rather short.  Fire in small, controlled bursts instead of spraying bullets everywhere, and you'll mow through your enemies in no time.

There are a few interesting firefight scenarios, but they get repeated throughout the game...namely, rush the machine gun nest or AA gun that's ripping your team to shreds.  Mostly, it's standard FPS fare.  The monotony is occasionally broken by the vehicle levels.  The first one, with the tank, is awful.  You can't really go anywhere, it's more of an excuse to fire big guns for about two minutes.  The second one, in a suit of power armor, is much better, but only takes up about eight minutes of an eight-hour campaign.  If you're looking for a stealth level, like those occasionaly thrown into Call of Duty, or even the ability to take on some scenarios with stealth at first, as you can do in Halo, don't bother.  Enemies lock onto you right away.

The bosses are a joke, and one of the game's worst features.  You will die quickly a few times with some of them until you learn to avoid their fire.  Once you do, one of your teammates will shout at you what you need to do, and from there, they are exceptionally easy.  The sole exception is the final boss, Radec.  Here's a hint:  Don't ignore the standard Helghans and just shoot at him, because you have to clear out about 3-4 waves of them before you get to a brief cutscene, after which you can finally deal him damage.  I literally emptied a sniper rifle into him, scoring headshot after headshot, with zero success, until I figured out I had to deal with his subordinates first.

The story is so tacked-on and pieced together it makes Gears of War look like a classic novel.  OK, it's actually on par with Gears in terms of memorability (which is to say, none) and depth of the characters involved. However, with Gears, you don't expect much other than over-the-top violence and tough-guy posturing, since the main weapon is a gun with a chainsaw on it.  Since KZ2 wasn't as over-the-top and more ""realistic"", I was expecting a bit more, and came away disappointed.  Yes, it's a FPS game, so it's not like I was expecting a deep, penetrating examination of the human condition, but I was hoping for more than, well, generic video-game shoot-em-up fare.

A few of the characters die during the action, but you probably won't care too much.  More like ""Yep, saw that coming.""  There's even a nuclear explosion at one point, but it's mostly done for show.  In Modern Warfare 1, when the nuke goes off, it was an awe-inspiring moment that actually provoked an emotional response, and provides you with motivation for the rest of the game.  I KZ2, it happens, you see it, you're impressed by the graphics for a few seconds, and then you move on.

I was at least hoping for a few good one-liners, but there was exactly one funny joke the entire time.  The rest was dialogue was mostly swearing and shouting and a few junior-high-level mom jokes.  I just finished playing it a half-hour ago, and I literally can only remember the names of my character, Sez, and one other one, Rico.  I remember Rico because he's the most annoying sidekick in the history of video games.  He does nothing but unleash a string of profanities and constantly urges you to continue to kick butt....but guess who needs you to come and revive him all the time?

Finally, you have the Helghans, the generic enemies of KZ2.  I think they are supposed to look like Nazi stormtroopers.  To me, they looked like the Overwatch from Half-Life with glowing orange eyes.  Speaking of which, glowing orange eyewear really doesn't belong on a battlefield.  Nothing screams ""SHOOT ME IN THE FACE PLEASE"" like a couple of bright orange dots.  Headshots come way too easily, just aim at the orange and squeeze the trigger.  They are also not the brightest foes, although, to be fair, most of the battlefields really aren't wide enough for them to engage in any serious flanking...and if they do, they are very easy to spot.  Just look for the glowing orange thingys.

If it were all about the graphics, this game would get five stars.  However, since it covers up a thoroughly average single-player FPS, I must rate it as average.  If you aren't going to engage in multiplayer, I'd recommend a rental.

During an outbreak at Fortune City, Chuck is framed for the release of the zombies causing the outbreak. Why would a horde of zombies only be secured by one weak fence, and how could they spread to all points of the map in seconds?... And why is there only apparently one emergency shelter in place for such an outbreak?...

...Uhm... moving on.

Dead Rising carry's over a majority of the mechanics from its predecessor with quiet a few improvements. Text is legible. The walkie is no longer as annoying, and can be ignored easily. Save points are more evenly sprinkled throughout the areas. Giddy points and disappointments are found with the combo weapons, which are tons of fun, but disappointing that you can't make them at their best until you unlock the ""combo card."" The camera has been removed, and I rather enjoyed that about DR1. In its place are bonus points for a much larger variety of activities and using combo weapons, which means you'll be using mostly combo weapons once the opportunity presents itself.

The Gameplay is otherwise just as you remember. Fight from group to group, grabbing new weapons as old ones break, collecting book powerups and hunting for rarer and more devastating toys. The number of weapons has gone up, though not as much as expected, though a larger area and more room to explore mean its somewhat easier to skirt groups rather than slog through everything. Levels and unlocks carry over as usual, making restarting almost strategic rather than frustrating. The level is much larger and more sprawling, but apart from being rather slow on foot, is easy to navigate and doesn't look cookie cutter from section to section.

Audio and visuals are as crisp as to be expected. The only deficiency is how few lines are used by the survivors and bystanders. Cinematics are fully voiced and well detailed.

Overall, the games what you've come to expect. Probably the most major downside is some of the times that were removed from the initial game that I'd have liked to see kept, and the lack of a sprint button. Those and some gaping plot holes right from the start are the only major smudges on whats otherwise a game thats just as fun as the original.

3.0,False,"11 14, 2009",A3TK2IOP8UQ087,B000X9FV5M,Alabaster Jones,"Wow this game is a total mixed bag.  For every good thing about it, there are 2 things that will leave you scratching your head or breaking your keyboard in frustration.

First of all, The Story:  there is no story.  It's just a bunch of NPCs sending you to the other side of the map to either A) blow something up B) retrieve an object, or C) kill someone.  That's it.  Every mission is the same, and every area is just a copy/paste of the last one.  There is no variation here at all.  None.  The weapons, yes, but you'll probably find a combo that you like very early on and keep it for the whole game.

The Weapons:  There are a lot of them, but like I said, you'll likely find what you like early on and ignore the rest of them.  One thing that really annoys me about the weapon slot system is that if you want to carry a sniper rifle, it will be your primary weapon, which means that you cannot carry a battle or assault rifle with the sniper rifle.  This would be okay if the game were sniper friendly, but it is not.  You will be able to pick off a few enemies before they all either hide or rush you, at which point your sniper rifle is going to do you zero good.  It's nice to have, though, so I use it anyway.  I have the double barrel sawed-off shotgun as my secondary weapon, which helps, but it is horribly inaccurate even at point blank range.  The enemies have a nasty habit of becoming merely wounded from a close range shotgun blast to the head, which is annoying for 2 reasons.. one- because it's unrealistic, and two- because you are often unable to finish them off until they have completed their ""writhing in pain"" and ""getting up to shoot you"" animations.  Your shots will simply pass right through them until they have gotten up and put a couple of rounds into you.  Highly annoying.

The Vehicles:  They are nice when they work right, but the roads are too narrow and the map designers were sadistic enough to put obstacles all over the road that will permanently make your vehicle stuck.  It's best just to walk.  Speaking of vehicles, watching an enemy NPC try to drive one is one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen in a video game.  You try to attack an enemy outpost, and suddenly it's BAD DRIVERS TO THE RESCUE!  These guys will come roaring onto the scene - hitting trees, buildings, cars, each other, and whatever else they can find.  They will not get out of the car until they are satisfied that they have run over enough things, even if you are standing 5 feet away from them.  MAJOR LOLS to the NPC drivers in this game.

The Combat:  Ok.. this is obviously the whole point of this game.. killing people.  Depending on who you ask, the AI in this game is either completely brilliant or dumber than a rock.  Well, I say it's both or neither.  At times, the enemies do seem to display a realistic intelligence.  They will hold their posts if you snipe someone from a distance, but they will find cover.  On the other hand, you'll see about 3 or 4 of them running around in circles for all eternity until you get close enough for them to notice you.  That's if they notice you at all.  You can be face to face with some of these guys and they act like you're not even there.  Sometimes you can be right in front of someone and they will say something like ""Where did he go?""  Other times, even the slightest noise will have an entire camp of mercs firing at your exact position, no matter how far away you are or how hidden you are.  All of that being said, the combat is actually quite fun.  The AI is adequate (as long as they're on foot LOL), and even though I would certainly not call them ""smart"", they do provide a decent challenge in one way or another.  It really is quite satisfying to clear an area, because it is quite tough to do at times.  And then comes the disappointment when you walk 50 feet away, come back to the area, and find that every one of the mercs you just killed are back from the dead and ready to fight you all over again.  The respawning enemies in this game are terrible.  It was an awful idea, and it is the worst thing about this game.  Wait.. no.  Malaria is the worst thing about this game.  WTF?  Malaria?  Well at least it isn't AIDS.

Other Thoughts: There is a lot of fun to be found in this game, but playing it often feels like walking up a muddy hill in lead boots.  Everything from the lack of inventory screen, tediously designed menus, really weak jumping, gun jamming, and constant malaria symptoms will have you believing that this game was designed to punish you for buying it.  But, the graphics, sound, atmosphere, and unique combat might just make you keep playing it anyway.

Is it a bad game?  Yes.  It's a terrible game, but I like it anyway.

To start this, the one I had the biggest problem with: xbox. Even if you install the drivers it came with (Small disc in the cardboard), or the possibly newer ones online, by default the xbox controller simply will not work. The driver doesn't properly install to the device, and has to be done manually. So before you plug in the adapter, install the drivers from the disc or from the official mayflash website (Just search mayflash drivers on google and you'll find it). I was able to correctly install the driver in the vista folder to windows 10 x64. Once you do that, plug your xbox controller into the adapter, and then the adapter into the computer. You should see an error message after a short while saying an error occured with the USB device. Use the search in windows (start menu in windows 7, charms menu in 8/8.1, and on the task bar in 10) to search and open ""Device Manager"".  You should see an unknown device in the window that shows up, with a yellow triangle on its icon. Right click the device, then click ""Update Driver Software..."". Click ""Browse my computer for driver software"", then ""Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer"". Select ""show all devices"", then click next. On the left, once the list loads, scroll and click ""TigerGame Limited"", and ""TigerGame Xbox+PS2+GameCube Controller Adapter"" from the right. Click next. When it asks you to install a driver, click Install. Once it finishes installing, you should be able to properly use the xbox controller, though you'll want to go into the controller settings and switch the controller mode from digital to analog.
The xbox port also has a DDR mode, which you may want to switch to when using an xbox DDR pad.

The PS2 port pretty much worked flawlessly, even without needing to install drivers. It was just plug and play.

Gamecube seems to work properly, though dance pads seem iffy, and often made buttons go all crazy. I have yet to test an actual GC controller, but will do that and edit this review once I find where mine is.

Finally, I found that some controllers require more power than a normal computer USB port can give. I found this to be an issue with my xbox/ps2/GC racing wheel. The GC port seemed to work just fine, but didn't allow you to use the pedals as an analog input. When I used the PS2 port, the wheel would power on for a brief second and then power off. I had to get a wall powered USB 2 hub and use only this device on it so I could supply additional power to the wheel. After doing that, the wheel worked perfectly fine. PS2 maps the pedals to X and square by default, but are usable as analog if you switch the controller mode to pressure and set those buttons to use pressure sensing. I've seen other people state that the gamecube Wavebird wireless controllers don't work. My guess is you can get them to work by plugging into a powered USB hub, which is needed because the wavebird can't draw enough power from a standard computer USB port. Unfortunately I don't have a wavebird to test.
And if something needs extra power on the xbox port (My racing wheel again), you can bascially forget about that. anything other than a standard controller and maybe a dance pad will probably not work. The device shows up completely differently when plugged into a hub, and as far as my testing went there is no way to bind the driver to the device while it is plugged into a hub.

All in all a pretty good adapter, and by far one of the best if you want a PS2 adapter for a dance pad. But because the xbox portion of it doesn't bind to the driver automatically, causing many people to assume it is broken or doesn't work at all, I have to drop 2 stars.","Good for everything but xbox, which is fixable and usable.",1449964800,10,,

The reason for this was never fully explained...but there was enough story to allow us to draw possible conclusions.
This time around, Konami has concentrated on giving us mind-blowingly sharp graphics -- from the full motion video sections all the way through to the in-game environments.  And with the several possible game play options, there is a lot to do as far as play and re-play are concerned.
However, the story this time is not very well developed.  And where there is some attempt at plotting, there are sadly few surprises.
As with the original game, there is never a complete explanation of the situation.  How did James Sunderland -- the character we play as -- end up in Silent Hill?  We learn that a note from his presumably dead wife inspired his journey but never understand much else about him.  When did he notice the world around him starting to mutate into the bizarre place he visits?  Why does so little of the strangeness around him have an impact?
There are plenty of attempts made to creep us out in this game and the enemies are definitely strange and interesting.  The puzzles with their multiple levels of difficulty are also a nice feature.  But, these elements just don't add up to all that they might.
This isn't a major disappointment by any means.  It just doesn't live up to the promise inspired by the first game.

It's certainly lightweight enough to not have any metal included. My other TB headset has metal in those places, which I think is more durable. On a brighter note, as I said, the all plastic construction does make the headset lightweight.  Unfortunately, I also I find it a very tight fit on my headmore than 'snug', I'm talking headache-after-a-short-time tight. Maybe this will get better with wear and time, but right now it's sure uncomfortable for me to wear for more than 30 minutes.

I am not an audiophile, and so I find the sound quality very good.  I have no complaints in that department.  I was pleased that all the buttons and controls are found in-line (on the cord) rather than on the earcups.  It makes finding what I want a whole lot easier.  The in-line amplifier controls and cable are only used for two of the four configurations.  For Xbox One and Mobile, the headset plugs directly into the device with its attached cable and 3.5mm plug; for Xbox 360 and PC, the attached cable plugs into the in-line amplifier, which in turn connects to the PC or X360 via USB or 3.5mm plug.  Included in the box is an Xbox One controller adapter, so while you're still attached to your controller via cable (as per all XB headsets) the controller remains wireless to your consoleeffectively a wireless headset.  On the PC and Xbox 360, it is not a wireless headset.

Right now the tight fit is the thing that bothers me the most.  I don't think this is a bad headset, but there are better ones in this price range.

Pros:  Open-ended environments;  solid graphics; good sound field; plethora of objectives and missions.

Cons:  Some graphical glitches; very repetitive gameplay; no native widescreen support; weak characterization and story.

This was one of my most anticipated FPS titles of 2008 and in some ways it lives up to it.  In too many other ways, however, it falls very short.  Just for the fun of it, I re-played the original Far Cry before receiving Far Cry 2 even though I knew that Far Cry 2 had no association and resemblance to the original at all.  They are totally different games with different stories, characters and locations with only the name to oddly tie them together.  To be fair . . . there are a few hang-gliders in Far Cry 2, so I guess there ARE a few similarities.  But, unfortunately, Far Cry 2 is a ""far cry"" from the original Far Cry.

The basic plot of Far Cry 2 deals with two main warring factions attempting to take control of Central Africa's resources and governmental powers.  The main antagonist is a chap by the name of The Jackel who is supplying arms to both side of the conflict, or so it seems.  The objective of the player's character is to assassinate the Jackel which is hoped will de-escalate the conflicts and bring stability to the region.

Some things work in Far Cry 2.  There are very large free-roaming environments and a host of real-world weaponry.  Many of the objects are somewhat destructible.  The graphics and sound designs are good.  There is a form of vegetation regeneration and day, night and weather cycles.  All of that is fine and dandy.  Even the basic premise behind the story is okay albeit under-developed and confusing at times.  A few (very few) of the objectives and missions are fun.

However, Far Cry 2 falls short in the following areas:

1)  Graphical glitches.  Aside from the ""clipping"" issues (which are in many PC games) I found several odd occurrences and annoyances.  One of the oddest occurred after I strategically eliminated the hostiles in a small guard post.  I was still receiving fire from somewhere, but as much as I scanned, I couldn't identify the shooter.  I eventually closed in on the source and found a hostile embedded in a huge boulder.  The gunfire was coming right out of the center of the large rock.  Occasionally I saw a head and gun poke out of the rock.  I couldn't kill him, so I just left.  There were several similar oddities throughout the game such as floating bottles, and the like.

Far Cry 2 also suffers from some general shielding issues.  Most of the time I could shoot through foliage, boards or walls, but there were occasional episodes where a few leaves would block my sniper shots.  On a few occasions I threw grenades only to have them hit leaves in front of me l and bounce back in my lap.  They should have easily gone through the leaves.

2)  The main complaint I had about the game is the never-ending repetitive nature.  Dozens of missions were exactly the same. The only variation was the location. I go to the cell tower to get the assassination order.  Then I travel across the map to where the target stands.  The targets all dress in grey suits and carry brief cases or clipboards.  They just walk around in loops until you kill them.  Over and over again it went.  I also experienced some glitches with these missions.  On several occasions, I successfully killed the target, but the script wouldn't activate as ""accomplished.""  The map still showed the objective as open.  The only way to continue was to accept another mission and abandon the glitchy one.

Then there were the ""destroy the convoy"" missions.  Again, most of these were across the map and when you get to the target, you find a truck - usually with one or two guard vehicles - circling an area over and over again.  You blow it up and move on.  After about 20 or so of these missions, I began to think that I wanted my eight hours back.

Then there were the idiotic malaria twists the developers threw in (to add some suspense to the boring game, I guess).  You get some transit documents you must deliver and, in return, you get the medication.  Over and over it went.  No matter where you were sent, the buildings were exactly the same with the guys by the door and the same families in the back room.  At this point, I thought that the developers basically scripted three or four missions and then just looped them over and over hundreds of times with tiny variations in location.

The only ""enjoyable"" missions were the mult-faceted variety where I had to complete several varied objectives.  These were usually given by faction leaders and, occasionally, by buddies. These were challenging and fun, for the most part.  Also, the very ending mission with the plethora of baddies was a little more engaging (FINALLY some action after 40 hours of gameplay!) Unfortunately, these types of missions were the exception, not the rule.  I would say that 80% of the missions were of the repetitive, redundant variety.

The diamonds used for bartering was fine, but to hide them in little suitcases on top of boulders, trees, and rooftops is rather ridiculous and, in my opinion, juvenile.  Maybe that was added to appease the twelve-year-olds.

3)  The AI was inconsistent.  Hostiles did pursue and flank, but not smartly. And it was very predictable.  The accuracy of the AI shooting was unrealistic.  Often hostiles ran at full speed while I dodged and swerved into brush fifty yards away and I was still hit numerous times. Yeah, sure.  Sometimes, I had to LOL as hostile vehicles flew off cliffs or into the rivers trying to get to my location. Sometimes unarmed vehicles came at me and all I had to do was to shoot the drivers in the head as they neared.  Idiots!

The spawning thing also was an annoyance.  Obviously it wasn't meant to be realistic.  I would destroy a guard post and then return minutes later only to find the exact same guards alive and well again and all the destroyed vehicles fully operable. I must have killed Joey the Guard like 238 times.

4)  No widescreen support.  I was shocked when I found that widescreen was just cropped full screen. Using widescreen takes full screen images and slices the top and bottom off and then stretches them to fit the screen.  What kind of cheap developer's shortcut was that!!  I did find a tool to correct it, but I expected something better from a premium 2008 FPS game!

5) I saved fairly often - mainly because I didn't want to travel the 40 miles over the barren African landscape over again if I died. But each time you save, the list has to ""refresh"" and depending upon how many saved games you have, the refresh time could be substantial.  I ended up having to visit the ""saved games"" folder regularly to clear it out.

6) The night play was too bright. I'd rather have night actually dark.  Stealth was non-existent.  I couldn't tell any difference buying the ""camo"" outfit for cover.  No matter how silent I sneaked up on a hostile and used my machete, the whole camp was immediately aware of my presence.  They missed a huge opportunity to implement a good stealth mode to the game.

7)  I was also disappointed that there wasn't more variety in the animals in Africa. I think it would've added a lot of suspense to the game to include a few dangerous animals.  I could just imagine walking upon some lions and then having to run for my life or gun them down.  It would've been hilarious to be trampled by an elephant.  It would've given the game a little more ""edge"" to it as well as some reality to the environment. I also would've liked some moving trains and I was a little disappointed that, at the airfield, I couldn't get into a plane to try to fly it.  Even if it resulted in a crash and death, it would've been worth it just to try to fly it.

Because of the tiresome and repetitive gameplay, I have to knock off a good 3 points off the gameplay score.  After playing the game, I am leery about its replay value as well.  There are no ""wow"" levels.  Everything looks pretty much the same.  The missions are very repetitive and redundant.  There are really no memorable moments during the 40 hours or so of gameplay.  Because of that, I have no motivation to play the game again.  Once through is enough.  Without a doubt, the original Far Cry was better.  In fact, I could play that again right now and look forward to every level of that game. I would score Far Cry 2 as follows:

There is no innovation or nothing special that will have you saying hey this game is freaken' awesome man.... yeah!!! ""Dungeons and Dragons: Heroes"" is a complete clone of ""Balder's Gate"" similar in so many ways,.... it's actually kind of scary!!!

 Yes, it was fun for a little while playing around with the 4 player co-op, which was a blast and even along withthe vast weapon and magic combos.... which gave you and your character a lot of options, when leveling up and such,..... beyond that there isn't much else to say. The level design is bland; the combat get's repetive, the graphics are choppy, and the game is overall a breeze; with maybe the exception of finding all 20 soul shards that will power up your weapons and abilites and such. The most annoying thing of all being the classic barrel/box smashing,.... hello were in the 21th century,.... be free to be more creative!!!

 Besides, the flaws though the game can be fun, like the boss battles are farily fun, but it was a game I played for awhile,.... left sitting there for about a year and a half and ended up really getting into it, though the game was barely a challenge to a gamer of my level easily beating the game less than 15 hours flat, combinding all the time I actually put into the game. It is a very solid game,.... but the camera pissed me  off zooming in and out at will give me a break. You do though get a bunch of Character options throughout the game. You get to choose between:

-a Fighter(Human): Built on strength/brute force and along with deffense, many physical attack combos: sweet finishing moves: ~ Assec. Weapon Sword

-a Cleric(Dwarf): Built on Wisdom and Charma, vast spell and weapon combos make this character interesting ~ Assec Weapon: Hammer

-a Wizard(Elf) Based around Intellegence and Magicial spells, and some other neat tricks ~ Assec. Weapon: Staff;

-a Rogue(Half link/ hobbit like creature) Based around Dexlerity and Technique, very small with a nice seat of daggers for serious death dealing ~ Assec Weapon (s): Daggers

 Each character is unique, with customizeable inventories attack combos, spell, magic, weapons armor, and anything that you would typically find in any basic RPG or Dungeons and Dragons board game!!! Best played together: it's painfully boring at times playing alone. The only thing that makes this game shine is the 4 player co-op and the D&D liscence, .... people give this game too much credit!!! Hey, in my opinion the orginal Dungeons and Dragons game blows this out of the water,.... and hey what's even the point of buying this with the new Dungeons and Dragons: Online game coming out for the PC, along with other games like Warcraft which are 100 times better than this. You also have new RPG's out like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Fable, and so many others which are way better than this!!!

 I mean heck, if you want to blow $50 hard earned on medicore material while, you could get Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic for about $20 bucks be free to it's a free country. Hey, I guess if you love RPG's or D&D you might find a lot of enjoyment,.... but this game is par in my opinion, no more....no less!!! I do think they could have had better quests as well,... for example the side quests were all stupid... and frankly pointless!!! Along with barrel/box smashing action and open treasure chest opening hunting for gold!!! It gets old after awhile,.... game developers try something new!!!

The plastic is a bit thicker than the official headset, which makes the Plantronics feel more sturdy and less like a toy.  You are still gonna look silly wearing it...

It produces similar sound quality to the official wired headset, so no issue there.

The problem I had found is that the mic doesn't pick up the voice you transmit as soon as the official headset.  This means that your first word you speak is normally cut off when you talk.  So whenever I use the headset I normally lead my talking with a noise or an ""umm"" to get the mic picking up the sound so everything I say is heard.

And it's not like there are a handful of generic animations...most fighters have the exact same ONE set of generic mannerisms. Even big fighters, who are on the box! I realize it's probably not worth it (or noticeable) having a different punch animation for every fighter, but there are plenty of unique elements about each fighter that are totally ignored.

- Reality: walks to the cage in a hoodie with a cold, grim expression. Single stomp when entering the cage, slaps her shoulders and legs
- Game: struts to cage in a t-shirt, talking and swinging her arms. Stands there, waves to the crowd (generic animation)

- Reality: does an armbar with her ankles crossed
- Game: does an armbar with her legs straight out (generic animation)

- Reality: after winning, stands there, smiles shyly and waves, poses with coach Edmond Tarverdyan
- Game: listens for her name and throws her arms up, poses with Mike Dolce (generic animation)

Are you sure this is a new expansion?' And indeed, the trailer video doesn't really show any MAJOR new obvious element, like say, World Adventures or the forthcoming Pets. The reason? Well there isn't a whole giant dynamic chunk of gameplay that's been added to the game, plain and simple, in fact, it harkens back to one of the earliest expansions - The Sims Livin' Large (for the original incarnation of the game), but it also reminds me a bit of The Sims 2's 'Hobbies'.

Essentially, what this expansion pack does is add a bunch of new little experiences for your sims. Those looking for a new game-changing way of playing should look elsewhere, because that's not what this pack is about. You can't really set out to 'achieve' all of the new features. Instead, you simply absorb them - sometimes unexpectedly - as your sims grow up.

Some of these updates are new interactions - your married sims can 'get frisky' as a prelude to a woohoo, your child sims can finally interact with the toddlers, and you can now give flowers or 'watch the stars' with a romantic interest. Some of them are new moodlets - teenage sims in particular can go on rebellious tears and mood swings, children can throw tantrums, etc. Some of them are independent new activities - teens can go on a 'rabbit hole' adventure to their prom or graduation ceremony, kids and teens can attend after-school activities or boarding school (helpful if you're not a fan of the young 'uns or have a big family), parents can be sent away on a 'free vacation' to leave the household free for teens, kids can dress up in costumes and play make-believe, and kids and teens can prank neighbours, housemates, or their school. Still others are social-based - stag and stagette parties complete with 'dancers' are now expected, weddings have been amped up a few notches (although really, they've mostly just filled in the gaps from TS2), teens can take driving lessons with their parents, parents can tuck their children in with a story, children can interact with an invisible friend randomly given to them at birth, and teens can throw 'teen parties' when their parents are away.

The most significant impact of these life experiences comes in the form of the new 'memories' feature that automatically captures your sim (or a placeholder image if you're not there) during memorable moments in their life, so you can scroll through their history and relive their first kiss, their wedding day, or even something a little more obscure - like the time they went skinny dipping or changed their outfit. Generally speaking I liked the TS2 memory book, and I appreciate this one goes a little deeper (by capturing screenshots, allowing you to input a bio for your Sim, and tracking their 'romantic reputation'), but I also think it doesn't add much - it's sad that it's one of the few major new features I can pinpoint. It's also annoying to have the 'memory announcement' boxes pop up every five seconds. It'd be nice to just have the sound effect come up when a memory is captured - way less invasive.

Of course, there are new objects (and subsequent interactions) to be had. The most interesting is probably the playground equipment - which includes a slip-n-slide, sandbox, treehouses, and 'riders' similar to those 25 cent rides outside of grocery stores. The chemistry set has also made a triumphant return, although it takes some time and practice to do much with it - it's actually very similar to the inventing table from Ambitions. That being said, I felt there were some missed opportunities. Where was the pool slide? Basketball net? Pool table? These are all family-based experiences that would have fit well in this set. The rest of the new decor / furniture objects have a very homey, old-person feel to them - think: wood paneling, cluttered, leather accents. Ah and spiral staircases are also back, many people will be pleased to know.

In terms of new stuff for your sims themselves, it's all very family-friendly gear - hoodies and mommy clothes feature big, and again, for an expansion supposedly about generations, I'm stunned at how few new items were added for the toddler, child, teen, and senior age groups (which are often more overlooked by the custom content community). You also have the ability to add body hair to men, and seniors can now hobble around town with canes.

There's also one new profession (not a rabbit hole career) - the daycare worker. So far, I have to say, it's probably my favourite profession because it's much less repetitive and challenging as the levels move up. The day FLIES by for my sim and it's the closest we've ever come to a true marriage of being able to 'follow' your sim to work - the other professions feel very repetitive, this feels very much what it'd be like to be a daycare worker, dealing with some unpredictable happenings.

Altogether, I'm right in the middle on this game. I really don't think it added the level of gameplay users have come to expect from a Sims expansion pack, and I can see a lot of people being disappointed. In fact, if you look at most of the reviews on this game, the majority of them are either uber negative or 5-star ratings with little to quantify it. There is one KEY feature I'm quite happy to have - you now have the ability to adjust the life spans of your sims per age group. So if I have a toddler achieve all of their skills and I'm ready for them to age up, I can now shorten that age phase to 2 days instead of the standard 7. That alone might be worth the price tag for some, and it is nice to have the game gently expanded instead of diving into one huge section of the game for eons (as I did with World Adventures) and neglecting what the core game is all about. If anything, I'd call Generations an 'Enhancement Pack' as opposed to an 'Expansion Pack'.",Generation Gap,1313971200,12,{'Platform:': ' PC/Mac'},

I'll start by saying that this review will NOT be about SOCOM's various technical snafus.  I've played the game through several revisions and I've had a fairly smooth ride from a technical standpoint. I'm going to review this game as though it runs perfectly, since I assume Slant Six will have it patched to that point in the very near future.

Instead, I want to discuss SOCOM: Confrontation as a game.  And as a game, I've found that it ultimately falls short of being worth its retail price.

The game is ambitiously conceived, and the whole reason I purchased it in the first place was that the designers worked very hard to implement a number of features that I found very appealing and intelligent.  Chief among these are the voice communication system and the motion-sensitive cover system.  Ultimately, however, both fall short.

The voice system is for the most part well-implemented, but the team-wide chat is the same as any other multiplayer shooter, and the local-area open-mic chat is too quiet and erratic to be useful in combat.  In addition, I've found that very few players put these features to use.  This is not necessarily the fault of the publishers, but it's unfortunately typical of the experience you'd have playing this title.

The cover system is a nightmare.  The game is full of awkwardly-proportioned obstacles that ensure that you will be firing into your own cover time and time again.  The game punishes you for finding tactically valuable high ground by sticking a railing in your face that makes shooting downwards impossible.  The only bright spot is the fact that you can make your character duck all the way to where he's kissing the dirt, then pop up and shoot.  Assuming you don't shoot your own sandbags, it's a good tactic that's proven itself in ambushes.

As for the mechanics of the game, they're decidedly sub-par.  The controls are needlessly complex.  For example, there are three zoom levels, which means you need two buttons to navigate among them.  Weapon switching is an incredible chore, and even though you have a quick-swap button, you can't configure which weapon comes up when you press it, so it defaults to your mostly useless pistol when grenades would be a far more desirable option.  Instead, you have to hold the weapon select button, fiddle with the D-pad to find the weapon you want, then release the swap button while holding the D-pad.  Even knowing how to do it, you still mess it up some of the time.  Also, for a game bent on seeming ""realistic"", it is decidedly unbalanced when it comes to movement and shooting.  Characters walking at full speed suffer no accuracy penalty vs. characters that are crouched still or even prone.  Call of Duty 4 and 5, which are more arcade-y in other areas, offer far more realism in this regard.  You have to slow down and use your sights to shoot at even moderately close range.  But since the 3rd person view makes shooting difficult, and players have learned that you might as well charge, the game devolves into a lot of close-range circle-strafing, which is decidedly unrealistic, unenjoyable, and just plain stupid.

To make matters worse with SOCOM, the online experience itself is not well-designed.  After using Call of Duty's simple, streamlined, easy matchmaking system, going to a PC-style menu of servers is a major step backwards.  When you make yes/no selections in the menu, the cursor lags and jumps around, often picking the option you DIDN'T want.  Another annoyance is that, while you can configure many different character loadouts, you can't switch among them without leaving the server!  Not to constantly compare the game to the Call of Duty series, but this is clearly inferior.  In COD, you can switch your profile any time you wish to adjust to the game type and map.  SOCOM does not allow this, which is a major annoyance given the fact that multiple equipment loadouts come in handy depending on the game type, and most ranked room run in medley form.  True, you can change your weapons and secondaries between lives, but these all have to be done one item at a time.  Also, you can't change your armor settings mid-game at all.

There are some good points to this game.  Character creation is deep, fun, and the instant availability of weapons and camouflage let you design your warrior just how you'd like.  The weapons have a realistic feel, aided by the outstanding sound design and excellent explosion and impact effects.  And Crossroads really is the best multiplayer map that's ever been made.  It's just spectacular.  I score markedly better on this map than any of the others.  I'm going to miss it when I sell this game next week.

But the best part of this game isn't part of the game at all, it's...

THE HEADSET
There's no denying it.  This headset is an outstanding piece of kit.  It's discreet, light, it functions perfectly, pairs easily, sounds great, is comfortable enough, and the battery lasts a long, long time.  It also survived a fall from about six feet up onto a hardwood floor, so I'd say it's durable.  I had to use the included smaller ear disc, since I have funny ears, but hey, they were nice enough to provide it.  Assuming future titles will have headset support, this is a must-own.

SOCOM: Confrontation is a disappointing, frustrating game whose many bright spots fail to outweigh its even bigger annoyances.  In an online shooter market packed with two Call of Duty games, Resistance 2, and the upcoming Killzone 2, there simply is no room for this game among its many superior competitors.",An Ambitious Disappointment,1227484800,14,{'Edition:': ' Bundle with Bluetooth Headset'},

3.0,False,"06 21, 2011",A21XZF5ZHKK5EM,B0001CJEJU,Antoinette Johnson,"First off, I absolutely love the Crash Bandicoot series. I own Warped, the first one, and Wrath of Cortex. Twinsanity is the newest addition to my collection and let me just warn fans of the series that if you buy this game prepare to get mad alot. Let me give a brief summary of the plot.

 I assume from the opening menu of the game that it takes place after Warped, with Cortex and Uka Uka trapped in ice. They get free and Cortex plans a revenge party against Crash that involves every enemy hes ever faced. Cortex fails, but later our true foes are introduced. Who are the main villians you might ask. Well two, twin, mutant, ultra-intellegent birds that used to be Cortex's pets, and are now seeking to kill Cortex. Yes. Thats the plot. Crash was never a really big story driven platform game, but this story is crazy even for this series. Oh well. Maybe thats why its called ""Twinsanity"". But enough about the story, lets get to main content of the Crash series: the music, graphics, levels, humor, replayability, challenge, and most importantly the controls which I have ALOT to say about.

Music: The music is the strangest I have ever heard in a video game...EVER! its extremely different from the rest of the series. I have to confess though the music grew on me after awhile. I actually found myself humming to the strange gibberish music playing for the levels. The music will irritate you when you find yourself dying over and over. I'll explain that bit later.

Graphics: The graphics looks great, but throughout my time playing the game I've come across many glitches and a few lighting issues. For example in the first cave level of the game I somehow fell through the floor, while on solid ground. Theres another glitch at the school level that...err I sort of exploited on purpose. You bodyslam a door and end up on the roof of the school. You can fall through the floor and end up breaking the game by getting stuck there too. I made sure to save my game before doing this. I also had a glitch at Cortex's Ice fortress. I opened the door to his base and died fighting a horde of monsters. I respawned back in front of the door, but it wouldn't let me back in! It wasn't till I left to explore a bit and came back did it open up again and let me in. Other than glitches, I think the game looks pretty good.

Levels: Twinsanity introduces the series to a more open world type of gameplay. Instead of going through portals are a map to get to your next destination, you just travel to the next level by foot. You would think having an open world gameplay world be alot of fun and interesting, but besides collecting gems and fruit, theres really not much to do in the areas that aren't levels. Another problem is that due to the huge levels, it can be extremely difficult figuring out, where you're supposed to go. This is extremely evident in the snowboarding and ball levels where you can take multiple paths and have an increased risk of dying from bottomless pits, that more often than not you won't see coming. The thing that will really, and I mean REALLLY, p*** people off are the cutscenes. They sure did p*** me off. In areas with a checkpoint AND a cutscene,you will have to watch the cutscene every time you die and have to start where you left off. This wouldn't be a problem if you could just skip cutscene like...I don't know, the OTHER Crash games, but the developers of twinsanity figured players would want to watch an unskippable cutscene everytime he/she died. This severly takes away from the pace of the game and is EXTREMELY annoying, especially on boss levels. These unskippable cutscenes actually made me ragequit the game for awhile. They nearly ruined the game for me.

Humor: This game is actually very funny. But once again the d*** unskippable cutscenes ruin it. A joke or scene stops being funny when you're forced to watch it over and over again after you die.

Replayable: Just like the other Crash games you have to collect crystals and gems. The gems are scattered in hidden places throughout the levels and are actually easier to find than the other games. The crystals unlock concept art and really serve no other purpose than that and I believe a secret movie. It doesn't feel as satisfying to get them like the other games though.

Challenge and Controls: These are the HUGE ones. This game is hard, VERY HARD, but some control issues make doing what would normally be simple platforming puzzles, hairpullingly frustrating. One of the things Crash is most noctorious is having simple, fun, and challenging gameplay, with simple, fun controls that mostly involve jumping and spin attacking, while running through levels. The first thing I noticed and knew would be a huge problem in Twinsanity is the controls. In the other games, when Crash jumps you can run and build momentum to easilly land on platforms. The games also made it easy to judge the distance of the platforms to determine how far to jump. In Twinsanty they screwed it all up. Crash's double jump barely feels like it goes far and moving Crash arounds feels more slippery than the previous games making simple jumps harder than they should be. This became extremely evident later in the game when you find yourself in narrower areas with low walls. More often than not, you will overshoot a jump, undershoot a jump, or accidently fall off an platform resulting in death after death. It took a long time for me to get used to this. Once again when you die in certain parts, you have to watch unskippable cutscenes (load screen included). Imagine after dying a billian times in a level, you get near the end with no lives left and die, causing you to start the level all the way from the beginning. I wanted to throw my controller at the tv so bad. The fact that there are chase levels like the boulder levels in Crash 1 doesn't help much either because these are worse. The spin attack is also pretty handicap because sometimes you will try to hit the enemy only for the spin attack to not do anything and you get hit.

New features: I can't forget to mention you can play as Cortex and his niece Nina. Theres skiing levels and combat levels. The combat level where you throw around Cortex aren't too bad. Thier actually pretty fun. The skiing levels are frustrating and I absolutely hate playing as Cortex. Cortex only makes me wish they let you play only as Crash or even his sister Coco. As for Nina, let me just say, shes bada**. While she can't double jump, she can easilly take out enemies and uses a graple to travel across gaps. The grapple didn't always respond when I used it though, which became a problem during the bus chase portion of the level you play as her. That bus part was frustrating as heck, and I finally got through and made it to the boss. Problem is I got a game over on the boss and had to go through that crap again. AAAARRRGGH!!

I give this game 3 stars. While many things about it frustrate the h*** out of me, there are still some things about this game I kind of liked and enjoyed. I found myself still playing with the purpose of beating the game and maybe going for 100% completion. I praise them for trying to give the series a more open world feel and believe if they fixed the problems I've mentioned, it could be as good as Wrath of Cortex are even up there with the first 3 games. In the state the game is currently though, its an either love it or hate it situation.",Prepare to be severely frustrated.,1308614400,,,

The framerate is consistently high, which is great when you are driving at over 120 mph.  (I play it in 1080i mode on my LCD TV.)  The career mode has some sort of storyline, but it's complicated and I just skipped over the poorly delivered dialogs.

The game is an arcade racer, which means its car handling physics is not very realistic.  A number of real-world nameplates are represented, and each does have its own ""feel,"" but the designers and developers made no attempt at making them feel real.  (The opposite of this approach is, of course, the venerable Gran Turismo series.)  The best thing about an arcade racer like this is the driving is very forgiving.  You can corner easily at over 90 mph, something you'll never do in Gran Turismo.  You can also turn off car damage and smash into everything and anything -- cop cars, oncoming traffic, etc. -- destroy them yet sustain no damage.  Because the framerate is really good, when you use the bumper or dash view and drive above 120 mph on an HDTV, you can really feel the rush.

The career mode has you race to win over territories.  You must place no. 1 in each race to win.  After a while, the races do get repetitive, as do the cat-and-mouse chases with the cops.  The city in the game, which seems to be modeled after L.A., is not very big, so after half an hour or so you'll have travelled on all its streets and highways.

~Areas of the world are 90% recycled from the first game.

3.0,False,"09 30, 2009",AXRHDLR4PN3OY,B0009VXBAQ,Kindle Customer,"The Wii is nintendo's most recent addision to the console market, and as such it carries a lot of expectations on its shoulders.  Nintendo has been making games for over thirty years now, and they have a legacy second to none.  As such, any product they produce must be of the highest quality, if only to live up to the hype.

The wii is a mixed bag, and only partially lives up to the positive press.

Construction wise the machine is fantastic.  I've dropped mine, knocked it over, kicked it, gotten it wet and it still works like the day I got it.  The controllers are of a similar build quality; I have abused them in a similar manner, even having a friend mistakenly throw one against the wall, and they are fine.

Beyond the construction, the Wii can be great.  Can being the optimal word.  The system definitely appeals, but to a different market then games of the last generation marketed to.  By this I mean that if you are a ""hardcore"" gamer, who revels in endless hours on the latest and greatest first person shooter (FPS), this isn't really for you.  Why do I say this?  Simple.  The games on the Wii aren't of this nature.

Most/all of the games are targeted at a much more casual group of gamers.  For Nintendo this is probably a great move, as this ""casual"" market is larger then the ""hardcore"" market, but for many of us diehard fans might consider this a bit of a let down, and if you are reading this you probably take your games seriously enough that you will want something more.  In the next few sections I'll break the Wii down a bit, so you understand exactly what you are getting if you buy it.

When you buy a Wii you get the wii itself, a Wiimote (wireless controller) and a copy of Wii Sports.  Technically there are two things that make the Wii different then the other consoles of the same generation.  First, and most importantly, it uses a non-traditional control mechanism called ""Wii Motion.""  This is a combination of infared sensors and accelerometers which allow you to ""interact"" with your games naturally.  An example is the Baseball game in Wii sports, which allows you to swing your bat by swinging the Wiimote in a swing-like motion, and causes your avatar on screen to swing his bat in the same manner.  This ""Wii Motion"" functionality is not used in every game, but it plays prominent in many; Wii specific games will doubtlessly involve some use of these mechanics, be it pointing at the screen as if you had a mouse, or shaking the Wiimote to spin Mario in a circle.  When not using such functionality the Wii controller can be used like a normal, albeit uncomfortable, controller by holding it sideways and using the traditional control pad grafted to one end.  Other games involve a secondary attachment to the Wiimote called the ""nunchuck"" which connects to the Wiimote by way of a small cord.  This also has some ""Wiimotion"" capabilities, but mostly is there for the extra buttons and a small thumb joystick.  I'd say that almost all the games I've played on the Wii, beyond the Wii Sports/Fit have involved this Nunchuck to a large extent, and if you are going to be playing a lot of games on your

Wii you will have to buy one (does not come with the Wii).

My commentary on the Wii Motion and control scheme is this.  It isn't great.  It's a gimick.  The controllers just don't allow fine enough control for most games, and they aren't really easy to use either.  Games involving Wii Motion features are mostly spent trying to figure out exactly what motion the Wii wants and then doing your best to repeat it.  This can be fun, but it isn't intuitive, and for most games it is just a pain in a neck.  Doubtlessly this is the reason many games on the Wii, including the latest Mario installation (Mario Galaxy), have almost no Wii Motion elements, and simply use the normal controller features of the Wiimote and nunchuck.  These ""normal"" features are fine.  The Wiimote-nunchuck combination is suprisingly comfortable in your hands, and control is excellent.  However, by the time you have bought both items you have basically paid $60 for one controller.  So, if you wanted the full 4 controllers you have paid: $200 for the full set.  This is compared to the $150 for 3 PS3 (or Xbox 360) controllers.  The Wii's controllers also lack a ""charge while you play"" feature.  This causes you to buy chargable batteries, or to buy lots of replacements, and the controllers do eat batteries.  Overall, I'd give the Wii's controls a mediocre rating at best.  I'd have much rather had a traditional wireless controller with good battery life, and a ""charge while you play"" feature.

Now, to give a holistic overview, we must address the Wii's software.  The Wii itself has great software.  The interface is intuitive and unobtrusive.  Updates happen very seemlessly and painlessly through the wifi, and configuration and setup is a breeze.  No one should ever complain about the Wii's interface, especially compared to the obnoxious layered menu system of the xbox 360, or the large tree of options presented by the ps3.  However, the system's interface isn't what usually interests users, so much as the games themselves.

The Wii's games...  Before I continue I want to make a small point about the Wii.  It is a hardware concern that I didn't mention above, but it really effects the games produced.  This concern is the fact that Wii is not much of a performance increase over the gamecube.  The result are graphics that are not as visually stunning and those found on the PS3 or Xbox 360.  Also of note is that the Wii does not provide true HD video, but merely some upscaled 480p.  These combined attributes are definitely a major factor in the sad truth about Wii games, which is that they are not cutting edge installments with the best graphics and the hottest gameplay.  Every game I've played for Wii has been one of a few

categories.  1) Gimicky use of the Wii Motion.  2) A Nintendo produced rehashing of one of their key franchises (Mario, Zelda).  3) A port from another console.

I'll expand on this categories with examples:
1) examples: Wii Sports, Wii Fit, Wii Sports Resort
  These consist of a bunch of mini games centered around use of the Wii Motion Capabilities.  Fun, but mostly just a gimicky display of a neat technology.  These are the most fun to play with others.  So I'd consider them a ""party"" game.
2) examples: Mario Galaxy, Mario Kart Wii, Zelda Twilight Princess
  Great games, worthly sucessors to the franchises, and the closest to targeting the ""hardcore"" market on the Wii.  Still, they are basically status quo for nintendo.  Don't expect anything magical with these.
3) Port
  Gamecube games updated and released, or virtual console games (emulated games from other systems --genesis, snes, nes, ect-- on the Wii)
  This category is great, and a saving grace, in my opinion.  I've spent probably half my time on the Wii playing virtual console games, but they are costly, ($5-$15 a pop)  and not original content.

These categories pretty much describe ALL games I've seen for the Wii.  I'd summerize by saying that the Wii has little ""original"" content, and  does not a vast library of games.  Games on it are fun, but they are gimicky party games to play with your friends.  It is a sad sad truth, but I'd say that the Wii is basically a gimped system, stuck with its core contigency of status quo items (Zelda, Mario, Metroid) and with little to no third party development going on.

I suggest the Wii for anyone who wants one of these few things: A bunch of Gimicky party games. More of Nintendo's staple fair, such as Mario. OR a never ending supply of old nintendo classics for download (costs money).

Do NOT buy the Wii if you want a modern gaming experience with all the bells and whistles.

I want to clarify before I end this review.  The Wii is a great system.  There is nothing better, in my mind, the bashing each other in a rousing game of Mario Kart or Smash Brothers.

3.0,True,"01 4, 2012",AHNT97DWEAQUY,B002BSC4ZS,Amazon Customer,"Before I even got the game, the word was out: this game stinks. At best it was a disappointment. That's what everyone seemed to be saying, anyway. Sure, there was a voice poking through every now and again saying it was actually pretty good, but they would get shot down by the more vocal ""It Stinks!"" group. I got the game anyways, figuring ""It's Metroid. It can't be that bad.""

And you know what, it really wasn't. Was it the great return to Super Metroid gameplay style Wii fun I was hoping for? The kind of thing that complemented Super Metroid the way New Super Mario Bros Wii complemented those early Mario platformers? No. In fact, there's a lot annoying with Other M. I would read all the gripes about it and think, ""That's a good point,"" and nod my head at what everyone was saying.

Yet I kept coming back to it, wanting to play it. I actually liked the story. The story was interesting and kept me staying with it to see what would happen. The EXECUTION of the story was the flaw. The melodramatics, yeah, that was a problem. The way the story handcuffed the open exploration that Metroid was known for, that hurt the game. The long cut scenes when I just wanted to blast away at weird alien lifeforms annoyed. I would argue that of all those flaws, the worst one was the fact that, as I alluded to, the story is told in such a way that it drives the game play to where it needs to go to keep the story flowing. That door you could go down and explore off the beaten path in previous Metroid games? Locked. Previous pathways are taken away from you as the story keeps pushing you in the direction it needs you to go to keep its beats going. This is where the Prime games were brilliant, you discovered the story as you went along, whereas Other M forces it down your throat.

The gameplay itself, I don't have much of a problem with. You run, jump and shoot and it feels natural enough. It depends on if you like the auto aim mechanic and I didn't mind it too much. If it took away my ability to shoot the thing that posed the most danger, it would be a problem, but I didn't find that to happen very much, if at all. It was a bit awkward to go from first person to third person to shoot missiles. The ""concentrate"" to restore your missiles and health was lame.

The boss fights were challenging, but after the majesty of the Prime boss fights, they felt a little lacking. The game does hold your hand quite a bit, letting you know where all hidden objects are.

Look, I thought the game was fun. I don't regret picking it up and it kept my interest throughout the run time of the major story mode. It's just not up to Metroid standards. I do appreciate that something different was tried and I think they came close to recapturing the magic. Metroid Prime was a giant departure from the side scrolling Metroids of yore, but it still had that same magic.

In the end, the thing that keeps the game down is the fact that it got away from the fundamentals of Metroid gameplay: the isolated open world exploration. Yes, in the end when you're done with the story, the world opens up for exploration, but it's too little, too late.

It's a fun game that people are probably too hard on, but that's because they expect the best from the franchise, and this game did not deliver ""the best"". Instead of recapturing the glory of Super Metroid, it plays more like a watered down Metroid Fusion (and I liked Fusion) with a character backstory a lot of people didn't want.","A Good Try, But Not Close Enough",1325635200,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

 There are no boss battles, you have LITTLE enemy encounters, meaning, you battle the SAME kind of creatures throughout the game.

There are TOO many secrets that she finds, there like 50 secrets in one level and 20 in others. its like she finds them in OBVIOUS places but then 20 steps later, she finds another. whats the point in having them if they are too obvious? plus the secrets only unlocks pictures, no cinematics, no outfits, just pictures.

you cannot replay levels.

you don't get to really keep all your weapons, you are given a choice to pick ONE before the level starts and it runs out of ammo.

The controller is technically ""plug and play"" (with Mac or PC) but in reality this is basically useless since the ability to program the buttons is NOT plug and play. I used this on both a Mac and a PC, and there are issues with both operating systems. Here is what I found:

Mac:
There is no software included with the controller for Mac and more importantly there is no Mac software available from the Logitech site. To advertise this as a Mac controller I think is slightly misleading. Again, the controller is only as good as the software. So, you will need to download a program called Gamepad Companion from the internet which works perfectly to program your buttons on a Mac.

PC:
There is no software included with the controller. You have to download the software from the Logitech site. The software is extraordinarily frustrating. In fact I have never seen such a poorly designed controller program. It will not let you program any of the keys unless you tie the program to a specific game located on your hard drive. I tried tricking it and tried going around the back door but the program is smart enough to know this and it still won't work. You have to have one of about three different types of executable game files on your hard drive in order to use this program to program your buttons. Once you have finished it will even try to open the game program itself and if it won't work it won't let you save the program! Pure fascism! So, I'm sure there are some third party options but I just ended up using an emulator program to do so since I just got this for emulation roms anyway.

This game is notable in that it doesnt feature Pierce Brosnan's likeness as James Bond, but an entirely new face that seems to draw from all the James Bond actors over the years.

Really, this is an average shooter all around. The enemy AI isn't particularly intelligent, and the graphics are decent but not noteworthy.

The main problem with this controller is the absolutely abysmal D-Pad. It consistently has issues knowing which direction you are pressing down.

Take Castlevania for instance... Most of the time you hold the D-Pad, it is either in one direction, right or left, and use B to whip. well unfortunately most of the time the D-Pad thinks you are holding up as well as holding left or right, so you always use your special weapon instead. Mega man 2 will consistently turn around on me, so if I am shooting at a boss or jumping from platform to platform, I almost always end up dying unless I am holding the D-Pad down with massive strength in the direction I want it to go. Sometimes it is also hard to select the items in the options menu because it will go either up or down. If I want item-1, it will go down to item-2 and vice versa.

The D-pad works when it wants to, and most of the time it is lazy. The buttons are decent. A and B work well and feel good. Start and Select are a bit flimsy but I have put them to the test and they hold up very well. The controller feels close to the original NES design except for the garbage D-Pad.

Mass Effect was such an amazing, nearly perfect game that surpassing it was an effort almost automatically doomed to failure.  But what surprises and disturbs me is how Mass Effect 2 seems to have intentionally fumbled that effort by taking much that was great about Mass Effect and deleting it on purpose.

At a surface level, much remains the same.  Dialogue choices and discussions are very familiar, and you can even import your character from ME.  Many of the same wonderful alien races and locations can be discovered, and you will delight in seeing familiar names and faces pop up from time to time.  But under the hood is a vastly different, and in many ways inferior, FPS/RPG.

1)  Combat.  The combat system has been completely overhauled -- and many would say weakened.  Instead of infinite ammo weapons that have an overheat limitation, you effectively have ammunition in the form of ""heat sink"" cartridges that you need to replace or your gun won't work at all.  In other words, you can't just wait for a gun to cool down -- you need to find a new ""heat sink"" clip.  Did the laws of physics change between ME and ME2?  This seemingly subtle change has massive ramifications on your combat styles, since you can't simply blast your way through areas.  You'll find yourself running out of ammo at inopportune times, or randomly changing weapons to guns you hate or that are inappropriate for a particular fight just because you basically ran out of ammo.  I have no idea why BioWare thought this was a good idea.  Perhaps it stems from the use of ""heavy weapons"" with extremely limited ammo -- after all, why use anything else if you had an infinite ammo rocket launcher.  But why not just limit the # of rockets you can carry?  The net result of this is that you will use weapons like the sniper rifle less often, because if you can only carry 10 sniper rifle bullets, it's a waste of time trying to take down fast enemies.  Basically, you're back to counting bullets like in a WWII shooter, rather than relying on ME nanotech to mill microscopic rounds off solid ammo blocks.  Perhaps the Geth's true plan to enslave the universe was to trick everyone into using horrible, backwards weaponry.

2)  Similarly, most of the cool equipment is gone or drastically reduced.  Instead of collecting different suits of armor or guns from shops or enemies, you find different pieces of armor that you can mix and match, or the occasional new gun.  But you only find new armor or guns occasionally -- after 15 hours of gameplay, many of my allies are still using basic starting weapons.  Armor is also rare.  Instead of picking exciting new armors and guns and customizing them with shield generators or ammo types, you have a very small array of items to choose from.  The entire loot gathering aspect of the game seems gutted.  While you may occasionally be able to research a 10% bonus to all sniper rifle damage, for example, that seems a poor exchange for ME1's dozens of sniper rifles and customizable features.  No longer can you add frictionless materials or extended barrels or toxic rounds -- you'll take whatever the gun gives you and like it.

3)  Your combat HUD has also been altered.  Instead of seeing at a glance the shield and life levels of your buddies, there is a small picture display at the bottom that shows their faces.  For some reason.  It is very difficult to tell if they are injured or in trouble, and often you just find out the hard way since it is hard to monitor your own health and worry about any random status displays from them at the same time.  Again, there is no reasonable excuse for this change.  Another annoying combat change is that when sprinting (but ONLY sprinting) your character usually takes cover automatically when approaching something.  At other times, you have to use a ""cover"" button.  But the same cover button is also the ""vault over"" button.  So often during a heavy fight, you will sprint for cover and inadvertently try to take cover at the same time, resulting instead in you just leaping over the cover directly into enemy fire.  It's maddening.

4)  The one gripe most people have about ME is the APC land rover, and how boring it was to drive around empty planets looking for mineral deposits or crash sites.  I'll give you that one.  However, ME2 somehow managed to replace this tedious exercise with something even worse:  planetary scanning.  With this horrible mini-game, you use a circular scanner to actually rove a planet's surface looking for mineral deposits or anomalies, which you find when your scanner readouts spike or the controller starts shaking.  However, even with an upgraded scanner the entire process is TORTURE.  It takes 10-15 minutes to do a single planet, and you can actually run out of probes and have to fly off and buy more.  Why could you spot anomalies and minerals from space in ME and see them on your rover map, but now you have to look by hand?  The entire thing is like pulling teeth -- I am honestly at a loss to figure out why anyone thought this was a good idea.  It's like something out of a Star Trek game from the late 1990s.

5)  Character growth.  You don't earn EXP for killing things anymore.  Think about that.  Instead, you usually (but not always) level up once at the end of each ""mission"" -- but sometimes if it is a side mission you get a whopping 125 EXP instead.  The entire thing is idiotic.  Combined with maybe 1/2 the number of skills from ME and you are left with an extremely reduced RPG element that skews the game far more towards the FPS side of the scale.  Mass Effect gave you EXP for things as mundane as opening boxes, while ME2 barely even notices when you shut down an entire factory filled with murderous assault droids.  It's amazing how this makes you feel like you are just wasting your time with most missions.  And things that mattered a lot in ME are pointless now.  An actual conversation I had with Captain Anderson went basically like this:

""So, want to be a Spectre again?""
""Sure.""
""...Congratulations.""

Whoopity doo.  Similarly brief and unsatisfactory interactions with the comrades you saved the freaking galaxy with in Mass Effect have all the feeling of cameos of people being written off sitcoms.  I think we can all agree that Wrex rocked Mass Effect so hard we'd all happily play a 200 hour side mission with him, and yet in Mass Effect 2 he spends the entire game sitting in a chair.  Literally sitting in a chair!

6)  Locations.  Remember the Citadel in ME?  Pretty cool place, right?  Well, in ME2 you can explore only a tiny fraction of it.  One level seems to consist entirely of Captain Anderson's room.  So too in many of the other locations -- there is almost no map divergence; you basically just run in a straight line from start to finish, with a few corners or stairways thrown in.  I honestly don't know what happened here.  In some places you feel like you're entering a giant maze or space station, but almost always you find out the maps themselves are tiny.  Another frustrating addition is the fact that levels and missions often end extremely abruptly and without warning, keeping you from collecting equipment.  Always, always, always pick up any equipment or open any chests before you move on to the next room, because every door or computer terminal could actually be the end of the mission, which teleports you back to the ship and prevents you from exploring anything else.  It's also painfully obvious whenever a fight is about to start, because you'll see a relatively open area with a bunch of boxes and low risers for you to hide behind.

7)  Graphics & code problems.  ME2 is as pretty to look at as ME, but I don't remember graphics problems with ME.  In ME2, I've seen people's heads on backwards, rapid fire facial tics, and even characters stuck in walls.  Also, the ""resume"" feature on the main menu is extremely buggy.  I've had it ignore recent savefiles and instead start me at a point 4 hours earlier in the storyline.  Save yourself some headaches and use ""Load"" exclusively.  Also hard save often; the autosave is relentless.  I've actually had it autosave while loading (with both indicators popping up on screen at the same time).  What this means is that if you ""resume"" and through a bug end up loading an old save file, the autosave almost always simultaneously overwrites your recent save with a copy of that old save file.  So unless you carefully manage your files, you can lose hours when your autosave gets overwritten.

All in all, ME2 is a step backwards.  If you gave the two games without any context to someone who has never heard of them, odds are they would think the original ME is the improved sequel.  After experiencing the lobotomized combat system, deleted RPG experience point system, scarce loot, and reduced maps of ME2, I can't really argue.",A Step Backwards,1264982400,27,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"06 10, 2003",A11A8GWG0IXBZH,B00005LABK,Mark Hills,"In 1997 LucasArts humbled the gaming world with the release of Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, a first-person action shooter that let players direct Kyle Katarn's quest to avenge the death of his father, Morgan and become a Jedi. The game flattened the competition with its near total immersion in the Star Wars environment that had been sorely lacking, even in the original Dark Forces in 1995. For twenty levels you became Kyle, the quirky smart-mouthed mercenary aiding the fledgling New Republic on a mission against Jerec and his cabal of Dark Jedi bent on locating and consuming the power of the Valley of the Jedi. A thousand years ago a great battle between the forces of light and dark saw thousands of Jedi spirits trapped within the valley. As Kyle you progressed in your powers until eventually having to make a choice between Light and Dark. To stop Jerec in order to keep the valley safe or take the power for your own and rule the galaxy.
 Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is set nine years after Jedi Knight, making it 14 years after the fall of the Empire at Endor, and Kyle has abandoned his Jedi heritage after nearly killing Mara Jade at the Sith temple on Dromund Kaas when he fell to the Dark Side. Still working for New Republic Intelligence, he and Jan stumble across an Imperial Remnant base that appears to be growing gem-like crystals- similar to the ones found in lightsabers. It turns out that a fallen Jedi and the Remnant are attempting create a Force-using army by combining the crystals and the Force. The first couple of levels are also painfully dull and the goals are often poorly defined. After encountering the fallen Jedi Desann, Jan is murdered by Desann's apprentice, Tavion. Secretly, Kyle flies to Rusaan- the secret location of the Valley of the Jedi. There is reasserts his connection to the Force. Reluctantly Kyle must reclaim that which he abandoned, traveling back to Yavin IV, he meets with Luke Skywalker in order to retrieve his lightsaber. At the Yavin academy, Kyle relearns his basic Force abilities in a test devised by Luke before traveling to Nar Shadda to begin his search Desann and the Reborn.
 Game play is much improved over Jedi Knight in many areas, not least of which is lightsaber combat, which is now handled almost exclusively in the third-person view. I had misgivings about this, but having tried it out, I see that it's much better- allowing for greater control and freedom of action during duels. Graphics are not through the roof 'awesome', but very clean and exceptionally well detailed. I have a ATI Radeon 9700 Pro video card, so I guess I expect all new games to be earth-shattering in their visual appeal. Raven did pay close attention to lightsaber duels from the Phantom Menace- giving the ones in the game a distinct cinematic feel, especially when view from a distance in multi-player. Mostly the game is fluid- the visuals flow nicely and Raven manages to overcome one of the Quake III: Arena engine's short comings by producing attractive vistas, whether indoors or out, everything has the right Star Wars-zy feel and look to it.
 Weapons range from Kyle's Bryar pistol, E-11 blaster rifle, Bowcaster and Repeater Rifle, plus new additions like the Tenloss disrupter, which can disintegrate distant targets in sniper mode, an EMP gun for dispatching droids and other electronic devices, a flechette cannon which is just a knock-off of the flack cannon from Unreal Tournament, plus a rocket launcher. Kyle also has access to munitions like thermal detonators, laser trip mines (a la Duke Nukem), and detpacks that can be blown by remote control. All three explosives and the rocket launcher do far more damage than their small, wimpy explosions would indicate. An additional weapon that Kyle carries that I really liked are the portable sentry gun- a cannister that once dropped deploys a blaster turret and begins shooting enemies within its range. Players also get macrobinoculars, bacta canisters for healing, and light amplification goggles. Plus you will find no end of shield and health power-ups through out the levels. One of the game's down sides is that it is difficult to tell when you're being shot- there are no accompanying green flashes or sizzling sound effects as your personal shields take a beating
 The game ships with 10 multi-player maps, customizable Force powers to fine-tune your character. You can even play games without the Force, though it tends to favor the dark side powers. Multi-player games include standard death matches, capture the flag, king of the hill where only one play has a lightsaber and Force powers and it's up to everyone else to deal with it, capture the ysalamiri (the Jedi Kryptonite creatures care of Mr. Zahn). One of the down sides in single-player missions is Raven split Kyle's Force powers between the Light and Dark side. He can throw lightning and choke someone, but no longer has Force Seeing and Protection- two powers that were, in my opinion, instrumental in the first game. I didn't like the addition of Dark Side powers that seemed to be there just to satisfy those players who think the Dark Side is 'kewl'. Raven also has the Outcast version of its Q3 Radiant level builder and other tools, like script managers etc. for creating single and multi-player levels.
 This is an o-kay game. It didn't completely suck me in like Jedi Knight did, but it is a worthy successor. It lacks the impact of Kyle's momentous decision between Light and Dark nor is the story as epic. And strangely, the feel is closer to that of the original Dark Forces than it is to Jedi Knight. Plus it suffers a little too much from console hell like Dino Crisis, where on some levels you must find the key to open the door in order to get to the next key to open the next door. It has some nice animated full-motion video, but nothing like the live action scenes that added so much to Jedi Knight. It is also a hard game- get used to not completing later maps on the first try even on easy 'Padawan' setting, plus some of the jumping can be a little frustrating. I waited a long time for this game and I'm glad I wasn't completely disappointed.","A Worthy Sequel, but lacking overall. 3 Stars.",1055203200,,,
3.0,True,"03 18, 2011",A2B68AP9VTKQDI,B003N0YCDA,R. Butler,"Special edition... Okay. I guess.

Granted, there's a lot here, but the comic was sorta cryptic until I played the game, the chips are sorta just there, the bonus disk was alright, and the Platinum chip replica was alright, I guess.

Still, I got a pack of cards out of it :D

Hah, just kidding. For 20 more bucks (at least it was $70 when I payed for it), this was quite a bit more than what most games dump onto you. Granted, not much for in-game value, but it's fun to show off the HUGE chip that comes with it. And the case is slick as well; feels leather bound and the inside is lined nicely.

How's New Vegas? Well, if you liked Fallout 3, you'll like this game. If you never played Fallout 3 (or any other Fallout game, for that matter), I would go ahead and pick this game up, but open a Steam account first (Google that if you don't know what it is) because you will need it, seriously; it only comes through Steam, and nothing else. Kinda annoying, but understandable.

New Vegas is basically FO3 on steroids, with a new Hardcore mode that puts a meter on everything, ramps up the difficulty, and so on; a slicker system overall, with better aiming outside of VATS (the turn-based element of the game), and the easier-to-use Companion Wheel; and a more interesting and hilarious story that feels like it could go in any direction at any time. Oh, and the awesome soundtrack, with a mix of real 40's/50's music that isn't as well known as what we've generally heard, but great nonetheless.

Still, Bethesda REALLY needs to work on their debugging skills: even half a year after it's release, there's plenty of bugs to be found. I know the world is huge, but there are still people getting stuck in walls! Help!

If you have a Wii, then you need to pick up another remote.  And if you are going to do that anyways, then you might as well plop down a few more bucks and get ""Wii Play"" along with it.  You are going to get at least ten bucks worth of fun out of this, and maybe a bit more.  The games are designed to train you in the various ways to use the Wii remote, and it is useful for this.

Probably the best part about ""Wii Play"" is that you get to use your Miis. Creating these characters is a lot of fun, but there are very few games that actually let you use them.  There are some brain teasers like ""Find Mii"" that are especially fun after you have built a bunch of Miis.  The fishing game is pretty stupid, but strangely addictive.  Air Hockey is good enough to enjoy, but bad enough to make you wish they would put out a better version.  Actually, most of the games fall into that category.

3.0,False,"01 15, 2012",A24WWT2W1M61AQ,B000MK2BF0,Lisa Traverso,"Walking into this game, I didn't have huge expectations. The game was based on the third Pirates of the Caribbean movie, which did not live up to the previous entries, though it wasn't terrible. Also, because it was a movie based game, my expectations were pretty low. Fortunately Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End was better than I expected. However, there are still problems with it that do make it a true ""movie licensed game"".

A strong point to the game is the story. The good thing about the story is that they don't spend the entire game on the third movie, which often times had an awkward pacing and tended to drag too often in scenes. The game instead focuses half of its narrative on the second movie, Dead Man's Chest, along with At World's End. This is a good thing, because the exciting scenes from both movies are recognized and it keeps the pacing a little smoother than the two movies. Even when you aren't in brawls and sword fights, At World's End the game still manages to pull off some enjoyable platforming and puzzle sections, along with some story moments that are accurate to the film and will be enjoyable for most. The narrative isn't the greatest, but the voice acting is solid and the look and feel of the game screams Pirates of the Caribbean, so it keeps in the spirit of the films while eliminating some of the other problems within the narrative.

At World's End's gameplay consists mostly of swashbuckling combat. The combat is pretty simple and straightforward. You will go up against enemies and swing your swords until they turn their backs, and finish them off with a blow. Along with this, you can punch enemies to stun them for a second and then hit them with your sword, and utilize a variety of weapons including throwing knives, grenades, and a pistol to spice up the combat. Fortunately, the game doesn't encourage you to mash one button, as using real swashbuckling techniques like punching and using weapons actually is rewarding, as it helps fill up a meter to perform finishing moves. The weapons also help add some variety to the combat. Other than these couple of cool flavors to the combat, it is actually pretty repetitive. While there certainly isn't that much button mashing, there isn't a great variety of enemies and difficulty as you go through the game. There will on an occasion be an enemy that takes a few more swings of your blade to eventually take down, and there are some stronger enemies that require a finishing move in order to be taken out, but that's about it. The rest of the combat gets repetitive, but not so repetitive that you can't have fun. If the game were a bit longer though, the combat would become a chore fast. In addition, though you play as multiple character throughout the game, they each share the exact same combat, besides some different finishing move animations. Other than these, the combat remains the same for each character.

Some segments also have you in sword fights switching back and forth between characters to take down enemies, and you also have to try and keep each one alive. Again, the combat doesn't vary much, and the AI of your friendlies is quite underwhelming, so these segments aren't very enjoyable, though utilizing some of the unique finishing moves of each character can be fun.

What is more fun than the sword play are the handful of fistfighting sections in the game. Thanks to some interactive environments, including objects you can pick up and use in combat, and the tone of bar fights in classic pirates fashion, some of these are enjoyable, although few and far between. You can use most of these moves in the sword play too, but the sense that you are in a bar fight makes these fist exclusive fights more enjoyable than some of the swashbuckling.

Some of these segments also have you switching between characters like some of the swashbuckling sections, but they are slightly more enjoyable because punches don't damage your characters as much as swords.

Besides the standard combat, At World's End also has a boss dueling system. In some of these segments, you will face character that you may or may not have faced in the film, such as Davy Jones, Will Turner or Jack depending on the part from Dead Man's Chest, and some other pirate characters you will meet in some missions. These segments utilize a sword dueling mechanic not seen in the main combat, where you will have to flick the analog stick in a certain direction to block or swing a high attack towards the head, a low attack towards the legs, or a stabbing motion. In these, you can also utilize counter attacks, special attacks that will allow you to hit your enemies in a single hit, and occasionally there will be a button prompt that will allow you to avoid a falling object or use the environment to your advantage. Like the main combat, these are pretty easy, however they are enjoyable thanks to the slight cinematic flair that they offer and they end with often humorous cutscenes.

Besides the combat, you will also spend some time solving puzzles which aren't excruciatingly difficult, but do break up the action nicely, and some enjoyable platforming sequences. The platforming isn't always thrilling, but on some occasions there will be some cool set pieces where the platforming becomes enjoyable. One sequence in particular has you playing as Elizabeth Swan as the Black Pearl is sinking and being torn apart by the Kraken. As Elizabeth, you will have to navigate a ship being torn apart by the Kraken as you are walking across the ship's mass and you watch your crew members being smacked off the boat by the Kraken. These segments can be enjoyable, and can provide some thrills in the game.

So in short, the gameplay is enjoyable, and the game has its moments, although some parts of it can become redundant and nothing here is particularly new or breathtaking.

The best part of At World's End is probably it's presentation. The game has the look, sound, and feel of a Pirates of the Caribbean movie.

The graphics, to start, are quite good. The character models look solid, the detail in the environments is nice, and the locations in the game look very accurate to that of the movie. The cutscenes also look pretty nice and the animations of the characters are pretty believable in there as well as when you are walking around. Not everything about the graphics is spectacular though. Sometimes in combat, the swashbuckling can look a bit awkward and slow, particularly when enemies just turn your backs and let you slice them. Also, the frame rate tends to drop when there is a lot of stuff going on onscreen. Still, this is forgivable when you are watching some cool sword fights take place, and when you look at the fantastic recreations of locations from the movie. Again, for today's standards, these aren't as good as some of the games we have seen today, although they certainly are good.

The sounds is even more impressive. While none of the voice actors from the movie reprise their roles in the game, the sound alikes are pretty spot on, particularly the person who voices Jack Sparrow. The dialogue isn't present that much during actual gameplay, but in the cutscenes it is quite enjoyable and gets you in the Pirates mood. The design of the sound is also impressive, with pirate battles, cannons, swords, and locations all sounding quite good and believable. There are sometimes audio sync issues that sometimes occur during framerate drops, but these are pretty rare, and the score has the pirates feel and is exciting, minus not having the main Pirates of the Caribbean theme song in it. Still, during the action, the music does add to what is going on onscreen.

The biggest problem with At World's End is the length. The game is very short, and I mean even shorter than the combined running time of the two movies. The game took me just under five hours to beat, and it was hardly a challenge, as I only died on some platforming sequences, and some occasionally cheap deaths during combat. There are a couple of hints of replay value, such as collecting scrolls, Wanted Posters, and other collectibles in levels to unlock some bonus videos and art work, but these are pretty joyless things, and if you aren't a big fan of collecting, this isn't really going to be a game you will return to. There are some multiplayer features in the game. There are some co-op missions where you and a friend take on swarms of enemies, and another one where the game utilizes the entertaining dueling system in one on one matches, but neither of these are online and don't have any expansion or reason to keep you coming back, despite the fact that they are mildly enjoyable. On the XBOX 360 version, there are some leaderboards for the Co-Op missions, but that isn't much more of a reason to keep coming back to the game.

So with all of these components coming together, At World's End comes to being good, but not great. There are some enjoyable moments in gameplay, the story is enjoyable for someone who has seen the movie, and the presentation is impressive. However, the game's repetition, short length, and tedious design to hut it a bit, making for an experience that has its moments, but the game was definitely a missed opportunity. Still, the game is enjoyable enough, and is worth an extended rental or a ten dollar bin purchase for fans of the movie.

Presentation: 8/10: The strongest point of the game. The story is more interesting than the third movie, although it isn't particularly fantastic for someone who hasn't seen them. Still, the feel of the game screams Pirates of the Caribbean, and this brings some enjoyable moments.

Graphics: 7/10: Looks like pirates, with some accurate recreations of scenes from the movie and some good looking cutscenes and moving animations. The combat can look a bit awkward though, and the framerate can drop quite a bit.

Sound: 8/10: The game does lack the classic Pirates of the Caribbean theme, and some of the voice acting of enemies is pretty corny, but the sound alikes of major movie roles are great, the score helps make the action exciting, and the sound design of everything going on screen is impressive, despite occasional syncing issues.

Gameplay: 6.5/10: Enjoyable, but flawed. The swashbuckling is fun at first and encourages less button mashing, but gets repetitive fast and is quite slow in pace, with some fist fighting sections that are better, but far in between. The dueling is fun and cinematic, but also a little slow. The platforming and puzzles help break up the action, and some of the greatest thrills come from the environmental set pieces during the platforming.

Replay Value: 3/10: A five hour long story is too short for two movies to work off of. On top of this, the item collecting unlocks some pretty unenjoyable videos and artwork. The local multiplayer is enjoyable, but not expansive at all or a reason to come back.

Final Tally: 6.5/10 An extended rental or a price drop bin purchase.","An enjoyable, though underwhelming and rushed tie in to the movie.",1326585600,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

1. You need 3 other controllers besides the Nyko guitar (they can be the rockband instrument set, or just any PS3 controllers. I used a DS3 a RB guitar and GH3 guitar)
2. You need all 3 of the controllers assigned to the PS3 taking up spot 1-3 except the Nyko guitar (goal is to assign the Nyko to 4 or higher)
3. Plug in the Nyko dongle and attempt to link with the guitar (it will most likely make the Nyko button turn red which is the color that won't play)
4. Turn the switch on the dongle back and forth once or twice ending on GH setting letting the guitar link on it's own (It may not assign correctly on the first try, but keep switching between Rockband setting and GH setting. Always end on GH, because it will work with Rockband on GH setting)
5. After a few times it should link and allow you to play

Obviously this option isn't something that everyone wants to put up with, but for $10 it'll work fine for my uses. Hopefully my instructions will help ppl that either want to keep the guitar or can't return it for a refund.

The guitar works well after tricking it into linking. I can't buy a guitar for $10 that will work on both GH3 and RB so this guitar is a winner in that regard.

NOLF and NOLF II is a spy game. You're a spy, Cate Archer, that is saving the world from H.A.R.M.
Both games had around 10-15 chapters, with most chapters with 3-6 scenes. That's a lot of gameplay.
Plus, NOLF I and II also had cutscenes, some story and character development.
It also had humor, which personally I thought was dull and not funny in any way. The type of humor doesn't seem intelligent whatsoever.
""Please stop pushing me!""  ""I will stop pushing you if you stop clinging to things like a little girl.""
Not funny to me.
To me anyway, in most cases, it insults my intelligence.
However the gameplay is pretty nice for NOLF and its sequel.
As for Contract Jack, it just doesn't seem the same.
First off, there are 7 chapters, half of what you'd get from NOLF and its sequel.
Second of all, some of these only have one scene, which makes it even shorter.
It also has little to no spy gameplay whatsoever. This is just flat out shoot people and get done with your mission.
Being it's also a flat out ""shoot the bad guy"" type, you cant fail any mission. There is no ""You blew your cover"" or anything like that.
Plus, very very few cut scenes, which are quite short.
Others had mentioned that the company was going to have Cate Archer in the game.
Well, it's quite the dissapointment. You don't see any cutscenes with her. You don't see her fighting or doing much of anything. You see a few posters of her, and while driving in the back of a truck, you see her standing along the road for only a second or two.
If you can play online, then this is worth buying.
If it's just SP, wait for the price to drop.
With no spy levels, no real cut scenes, not as many scenes, and not as many chapters, this will end a LOT faster than the NOLF series.",No One Lives Forever VS Contract Jack,1078099200,,,

While it's unlikely it will ever win any awards on 'looks', the G110 is a good 'typing' keyboard that features solid macro capabilities. The G110 comes short from being 'best in class' but it can be a keeper if, let's say, Santa dropped it under the Christmas tree for someone who really, really wanted a keyboard that did macros and came with a few nice extras.

THE KEYBOARD

- Packaging, contents -

Only good things here. The body, and the wrist rest are packed securely and they are easy to extract and assemble. A special enclosure hosts the CD along with a folded-paper style 'manual' that also includes the warranty statement.

- Build, look and feel -

While of a sufficiently solid build, there is a feeling of 'cheap plastic' probably because the 'black' is more like a very dark grey and the design is dated, giving the impression of unnecessary bulkiness. However, the keys are placed where expected and typing is good - I am a touch typist so I can tell a good keyboard from a not-so-good one and this happens to be a 'good' keyboard. First I thought that the keys traveling a little too deep when hit would interfere with my typing but this is not the case at all. I can type very fast on the G110 and my typing is as accurate if not more so than on my other gaming keyboard - the beautiful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SideWinder-X6/dp/B001DWI4FM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SideWinder X6</a>.

Further ergonomic enhancements include the keyboard's ability to rise on its little legs if needed and the detachable hand rest.

The keyboard connects to the computer via a reasonably long USB cable that can not be detached. I would have preferred if it connected via a 'standard' USB wire so that a problem with the cable would not make the keyboard unusable but, in fairness, most keyboards are built this way.

- Warranty -

Logitech provides the usual 1 year limited warranty where Logitech, at its own discretion, will replace or fix your item with a new or refurbished one. And you may have to pay for shipping if the local laws allow for it, and so on. Make sure to save your proof of purchase.

GAMING FEATURES

- Hardware enhancements -

The USB port (not for powered devices) could be viewed as a gaming enhancement. I would have liked to see more than one USB port but even one is a welcome enhancement.

The keyboard also comes with headphones and mic jacks, allowing you to plug a non-USB headset directly into the keyboard. Very well placed (above the number keypad) volume scroll, a speaker mute buttons and play/pause, stop, skip buttons are also present.

Specifically for gaming activities, there are 12 'G' macro keys on the left side. the M1/M2/M3 and MR buttons above allow the gamer quickly record and assign macros and to switch between 3 macro banks for a total number of 36 macros per profile (software will allow you to specify an infinite number of profiles - see below).

Keys backlighting will let the user select one of 4 colors for each of the 3 macro banks and on specific profiles. You can pick a 'custom' color, if so desired but, since all colors are shades in-between red and blue, whatever you pick is going to look more or less like one of the 4 defaults red, blue, purple and cyan. All keys get the same backlight color, except for the M1/M2/M3 wich are always yellow and the MR which is always red when active. Except for the red backlight, the other colors are a little dim and there is no brightness control, only an on/off button.

A switch allows for disabling the Windows/Context Menu keys.

- Macro capabilities -

Once installed, the Key Profiler software will allow for a great deal of flexibility when it comes to customizing each of the 'G' macro keys.

On each G key one can:

* assign keystrokes
* assign a macro by either creating one or picking a previously saved macro
* disable the key
* invoke the Macro Manager to record a new macro or do some limited editing on an existing macro
* assign a specific function such as mail, calculator or media player to the key
* assign a shortcut by either browsing or typing it and with the ability of specifying a working directory
* assign a text block (simulate typing) with the ability to enter a specific delay time between characters (in milliseconds)
* assign a script - this one I could not make it work yet but it seems that Lua is the only supported language.

The defaults for the M1 macros are the actual F keys (unless reassigned, F5 will refresh, F1 will bring up help and so on).

Outside the Key Profiler, it's possible to quickly assign a macro to a key by pressing the MR key, the specific G key to assign the macro to, typing the required keystrokes and then pressing the MR key again to end the process. It can be all done in a few seconds. If needed, the macro can be later edited with the Macro Manager. Optionally, it's possible to record not only the keystrokes but also the time delays between keystrokes.

Besides the Default Configuration, new profiles can be created, imported and so on and each profile can have its own 36 macro key assignments as described above.

EVALUATION

I am pleased to state that the keyboard turned out to be better than my initial expectations - looks can and often are deceiving. I was first bothered by the fact that the keys seem to travel more than I thought I was comfortable with but, surprisingly, I could touch-type on it almost immediately without my fingers getting tired. I will not keep the G110 as my own keyboard - the one I use to write long reviews, dozens of emails and create or edit complex documents - because one of my kids really, really wants it and, since he is more of a keyboard gamer than I am, this speaks good for its gaming capabilities.

I liked:

- the way the keys feel when touch-typing
- good placement of certain extra controls such as the volume scroll
- the ability to create simple macros on the fly
- responsiveness of the macro keys
- USB, mic, headphone ports

I didn't like:

- the bulky design, cheap looks
- dim backlight keys, lack of a brightness control, poor color choices
- inability to assign backlight colors to the macro keys that are different from those of 'regular' keys
- inability to assign macros to the rarely used numeric keypad
- the macro editor being only 'basic'

While the G110's macro capabilities may appear impressive, just about everything that can be done with it can be also done with many other models, and some can be had for significantly less. Because I find that the G110 'does the job' but it does not stand out apart from the crowd, 3 stars (means ""It's Okay"") would be the fair rating.",Okay but not best in class,1261612800,4,,

Why give me a sniper rifle if enemies endlessly spawn until I get close to their position?  I mean wtf?

3.0,False,"11 19, 2010",A11V02E301PMGH,B002BSC4ZS,M. Weekley,"Metroid Other M is an enigma of sorts.  You have a legendary video game icon who has a new story introduced into the series and makes noble attempts to take the formula in the past and evolve it through creative bursts.  While I have always embraced the creative benchmarks in this series (ie Metroid Prime) and can acknowledge there are some good elements of this game, in the end Metroid Other M loses any sense of identity as it borrows from other games without understanding its roots while at the same time not committing to being its own game.  The end result is like eating at a buffet style restaurant...there are many good things in the mix but they don't compliment one another and won't leave you with a memory of an amazing meal but rather something that filled you up.

Starting off with the good, Metroid starts off with some top of the line graphics for the Wii.  In the era of HDTV's and graphical prowess, Other M taps into all of the resources of the Wii and creates some gorgeous environments.  The gameplay is creative and unique with first person/third person gameplay and tries to spice up things with more quick action timing sequences and physical gameplay.  I thought it was a nice touch that Samus sometimes had a more physical approach to attacking her enemies and gave the game a harder edge.  The story of the game I thought was pretty solid and fit well within the Metroid universe while the script of the story was lacking, the voice acting was, for the most part, very well done.

One of the biggest letdowns of this game is the emotional disconnect the player has with Samus.  Metroid games to me create a universe of solitude and abandonment.  Unlike a lot of games out there that put a lot of production into how alone you are, Metroid has always put you into a place of despair without much fanfare and made you feel that you truly had little to hope for.  In Other M, the solitude has been replaced for a need of grand production and fanfare which really isn't fit for Samus style.  Unlike other great games that use cinematics to tell the tale, the stories have always been told within the context of the environment leaving you, the player, to your own imagination.  Samus always dealt with the cards she was dealt without making a big spectacle.  With the recent introduction of cinematics and dialogue, Nintendo has taken a direction of telling you HOW the story unfolds rather than giving the player a chance to discern for themselves.  This results in destroying the heart of what has made Metroid so memorable.

The other largest complaint about this game is bringing together ideas that don't seem to fit.  Other M struggles with sticking with a gameplay element and mastering it which results in a hodgepodge of design choices that don't quite fit together.  I found it odd that there were random moments throughout the game the camera would fixate over Samus shoulder similiar to Resident Evil and force you to walk through an era in an attempt to build suspense.  The problem is that Metroid isn't Resident Evil.  The constant chatter you have between Adam and you and forcing you down certain paths and giving you upgrades in the process was another gameplay element that has been overused time and time again, most notably introduced in Metal Gear.

The last complaint about this game is the linearity.  I mentioned above about how Metroid games used to give you a sense of solitude.  In Other M, you are always commanded and told what to do which takes away the free exploration and makes you feel as if the system is always telling you what you should do next.  While it could be argued that there are other Metroid games that do similiar things, usually there is a vast chasm of rooms and multiple paths that lie between where Samus currently is vs. where she had to go.  In this game, the environment is very restricted in making sure you only have a couple of options and in the end, you will always end up where you intended on going.  When you introduce this stronger method of guidance, it takes away the feeling that the world is 1000x's bigger than you are and puts the game more in control than you as the player.  It results in a disconnected experience as instead of exploring your environment in a vast world based on your own decisions and living with those consequences, you're just doing what the game is telling you to do.

At the end of the day, Other M is not a bad game but rather an experience sprinkled with creativity and disappointment.  I left the game feeling moderately entertained for the time but, in the end, will find the experience forgettable.  To ensure you get the most out of it, I highly recommend a gamer come in with 0 expectations.  Those who do will be the ones who stand the best chance at appreciating the games rewards.

I was excited to upgrade to the new one. Sold my old one, got the new one and a few games, loved the games and after playing them found out the horrible news. No more media center support!!!

Why would they remove such a great feature?

I have Windows 7 & Windows 8 machines and used the Xbox as sort of a cable box.
I do not have Satellite or CableTV (not worth the price), so I have an antenna, network tunner and use a PC to DVR with. Now with this thing that just complicated everything. Now I am required to have a computer actually at my TV vs. before could use my main machine and stream to the xbox.

This one requires you to use either DLNA or ""push/play to"" from a computer on a per title bases. Before I could use just like a DVR and was great.

MS has decided it's better to make cable companies happy and remove the feature and just let you hook a cable box to the HDMI input. Well that forces those of us without providers to not have as much use.

Had I known I wouldn't have upgraded.
Worse is, I get HBO Go for free with my internet (no TV box etc. still, just online portion I get) and 6+ months later I still can't watch it on the XBOX, despite during release they bragged how it would be out.

The old XBOX could also be used as a cable box for AT&T, Xfinity and Verizon to save on box fee's, but with the new box all the providers have backed out because of MS they just say hook your box to the HDMI if you want to ""integrate"", never mind the point was to avoid further costs...

When I finally got it I wasn't disappointed to an extent.

But I was disappointed by the fact that it could have been done much better.  Don't get me wrong, the maps are great and the cars are fine but it seems some of the special weapons aren't that fun to use and most of the vehicles seem weak or too average.

If I could sum up this game in one sentence, I would say: This game feels like a glorified, less-fruity, tweaked re-skin of Mugen Souls. If that sounds bad to you already, steer clear because you'll be wasting your time. If not, read on.

By glorified, I mean they put more time and energy into the presentation of the game, making it look a lot better than Mugen Souls. For the most part... There are a lot of good designs and concept art associated with this game, but that only does so much for the game itself. As far as graphical detail goes, it's pretty minimal, and for a game that came out so late in the PS3's life cycle, it's downright disappointing. Most of it looks like a late PS2 game remastered to 1080p.
Behind that, however, is hiding something much worse. I can see why they used Uematsu and Amano's names as part of the game's advertising. It's because there aren't any other standout merits this game has. Graphical detail is something I typically overlook, but with how little the game has to offer, I can't let it slide this time.

The game revolves around Fang, and his unwanted quest that's suddenly thrust upon him by pulling a divine blade called a ""Fury"" from the ground, which contains the stereotypical moe character of the game, and fairy, Eryn. She persuades the stereotypically lazy, good-for-nothing Fang to collect all 100* furies so they can revive the goddess who's been sealed away along with the vile god whom they do not want to be freed. They soon meet a stereotypically sophisticated yet slightly masochistic girl named Tiara and her adorable fluffy fairy Cui. Hilarity ensues, due to Fang, Eryn and Tiara's clash of personalities, and with the other characters they meet along the way. The story is pretty light-hearted and silly most of the time, but most events feel pretty contrived.

Now, if you have played Mugen Souls before, you'll definitely feel a bit of deja vu upon entering the first region, the Sol Plains. Each region has different zones that are very linear. There is a bare minimum of exploration in the game overall, and it's only for finding treasures that are mostly useless in the grand scheme of things.
There basically is no overworld; you just navigate a menu instead. This is pretty boring sure, but makes character management quick and easy. You can pull up your menu pretty much anywhere. The only other interesting thing about the ""overworld"" is how you can manipulate the stats of your characters and enemies via ""world shaping"", by placing your Furies into the earth close to an area on the world map.

Character customization is pretty well-done, but not very balanced. You can choose to focus your characters' parameters around magic or physical attacks, but magic is pretty pointless aside from the stat boosts and healing spells. With physical attacks, you can add combos and customize them to your liking, making your standard attack command much more powerful. The Furies you obtain throughout the game have fairies in them as well, which you can sync to your character for additional bonuses and level the fairies up, which unlocks higher stats and abilities, and makes ""world shaping"" easier.

The battle system is decent, despite being very similar to Mugen Souls. It's turn-based, and your characters and your enemies will move freely each turn and attack within their range, which is generally based on which default weapon they use. Furies can shape-shift though, allowing your sword-weilders to use axe attacks and so on, depending on the character (once you unlock them, that is). A feature called ""Fairize"" (your character transforming via the power of their fairies) is used once you've built up your characters' special gauge enough, giving you a boost to attack and defense. However, the gauge becomes easier to diminish in this state, which will lower your attack power, and cancel out Fairize if it gets too low.

So, that's all out of the way, so why did I give this game 3 stars?

First, the regions. This is probably the laziest level design I have ever seen, and the worst part of the game for me. Not only is every single level linear, they are tiny. Unless you don't skip any battles, expect each region to be over with before long unless you haven't grinded enough for the boss. You won't have to grind too much though if you play the sidequests along your journey, but this will often require you to complete a region, get the quests, then go back to the same region to complete them. This type of padding needs to stop.
Oh, but that's not all. About halfway through the game, you will be required to redo many regions due to a certain part in the story. Not only THAT, you will find yourself unlocking new regions with the EXACT SAME DESIGNS AS PREVIOUS LEVELS. In fact, there's two of each level design, except for one, which has three... Compile Heart, you should be ashamed of this.
Oh, but even then, I'm not even done. While exploring the regions, you will be playing at a frame-rate of about 20fps, and depending on how much is on-screen, probably lower. For a game with little graphical detail, this is inexcusable, even at 1080p. Battles have an inconsistent frame-rate as well.

Utilizing world shaping and the character customization properly will break the game's difficulty instead of just giving you an advantage. You will be able to rack up WP (weapon points) without much effort about halfway through the game, allowing you to unlock every skill and regular attack combo, making the rest of it a joke. By the time I got to the end, I was winning battles in the final dungeon before my enemies could even attack, and during the final boss, I didn't even have to heal my characters at all.

Halfway through the game, you will find yourself in a point-of-no-return where if you wanted to 100% complete the game, you have to make sure you do everything, and do it all in the right order. This is tedious and annoying because if you don't complete Guillermo's sidequests before that point, you can't go back and fetch many of the items required to complete them. Lola's sidequests are ALL missable, forcing you to enter and exit a new region once you unlock it because that's when they become available. If you try to wait until after you complete the region first, the quest will be gone permanently. Expect to grind for money too, because you have to pay a lot just to start these.

Many boss battles are interrupted due to a story event, such as how your characters are struggling to win. However, there is no clear trigger or point of this because every time it happened, I was winning by a long shot. The battle will often resume with the boss back at full HP, but your characters will be where they left off before. This was really annoying more than anything.

The characters aren't very interesting, and many of them exist only for fan-service. You know, the anime kind. The only characters relevant to the main plot in your party are Fang, his fairy Eryn, and Tiara with her fairy Cui. Yes, Cui, the animal-like fairy who can't even speak is more relevant to the plot than most party members who are essentially tag-alongs. I don't understand why RPG makers insist on having about 6 party members if most of them are pointless.

Cutscenes are also pretty poor. It's hard to tell what's happening when the game uses standard dialogue scenes when there's supposed to be some sort of action taking place. Even though I wasn't pleased with the graphics, more animated cutscenes would still have been better than looking at HD talking still images the entire time.

A lot of enemies and animations are obviously copied-and-pasted from other Compile Heart games. Once again, lazy.

The soundtrack is pretty dull. Yes, it's scored by Nobuo Uematsu and his band, the Earthbound Papas, but most songs were forgettable or annoying. This is not classic Uematsu, so don't expect it to be.

Overall, it's an OK game with lazy game design choices. I wish the game developers put more effort into the game itself instead of trying to market it with famous names as something better than it really is. In fact, if you haven't played&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mugen-Souls/dp/B0087OY17Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mugen Souls</a>&nbsp;yet, I would actually recommend that instead if you can handle the cute, fruity, fanservice parody nonsense that it is, at least.

3.0,False,"05 12, 2010",A27G9LMQTMND03,B000JLIXI6,Patrick_91,"Genji Days of the Blade was a launch title for the PS3, I was reluctant to get it when it was $69 due to my previous negative encounter with Genji: Dawn of Samurai. Its safe to say at this point I'm glad I waited and picked this up for $5 at a pawnshop.

Genji Days of the Blade (Genji 2) takes place pretty much after the events of Genji 1, people who didn't play the first Genji need not worry, the events of the game are shown to you before you start playing Genji 2. Yoshitsune and Benkei both make a second appearance in this game, you also get to play as Shizuka who was previously unplayable in the first game. Also joining the cast is the god of war Buson who has decided to use the body of Genji 1's boss. Overall the characters all have some sort of negative trait to them except for Yoshitsune who can practically attack non-stop, Benkei is absolutely useless, hes much too slow to do anything except for when you have to use his special attack, he is really painfully slow, sure he has massive attack power, but what good is it when you can only get in 1-2 hits before taking a few hundred point of damage? Shizuka is a little faster at attacking the Yoshitsune, but can only string together 4 combos at a time and then slightly pauses, causing her to take lots of damage, and of course being a female character her defense is pitifully low, this wouldn't be bad if you didn't have to worry about her dying, but if even 1 character dies, its game over and you have to start from the beginning! Then there's Buson, sure he looks badass, but his move set stinks, you have to always strife to get his true move set, so he will sting together 4 attacks then you have to time his strife to do another 4 attacks, useless for some bosses as they move to fast for you to get any decent hits in. Basically what I'm getting at is even though you seem to have 4 characters, there is only 1 useful one, Yoshitsune. The other characters are just along for the ride.

Now there's the story, my god, its painfully dull, bland and useless. Space Invaders has a more moving story than this game. The voice acting tries to stay true to the Japanese theme and uses people with Japanese accents, Bleh hated it, the characters feel dull and lifeless,not enough character development going on. I couldn't care less if Yoshitsune's love interest died saving his life or if it was the other way around. To sum it up, boring story, never have I cared less about a story this much....

For the battle system, to some it up, You ever play Dynasty Warriors? Cause Genji 2 is a DW clone, you fight hordes of enemies and then have a boss battle, watch a few cut scenes in between the regular battles and the boss battles, rinse repeat. There is also a limited set of items adding a false difficulty to the game, then you have save points that can be within 10 minutes of each other or 1 hour within each other, that's just plain stupid, and really grinds my gears when I only want to play a 30min session, but have to go another 30-40min longer than planned because I have to find a save point. very frustrating! And now for the biggest complaint, Genji 2 employs the use of a fixed camera...a FIXED CAMERA this can make things much more harder than they need to be in this game (it seems Sony slapped on another layer of false difficulty) you might be running around like a headless chicken, only to discover your destination was just a few more feet forward, but you cant see the door because the fixed camera won't change the angle to let you see this door, also get used to being hit off screen almost all the time. Needless to say,the fixed camera should have had many more angles of the same area as it makes the bad camera angles in Devil May Cry look good. Then there's is that useless smudge on the screen known as the mini-map, it doesn't tell you where to go and doesn't display the location of an enemy very well, The game probably didn't even need the mini-map,its that useless.

The only redeeming factor of this game is the graphics....erm I mean character models, in all fairness they look really good (probably the best looking characters in the PS3's first year out),but what good is that if everything else in the game is bad? Overall I cannot recommend this game. Get Ninja Gaiden Sigma instead if you want to play as an asswhuping Ninja!

Pros:

+Great looking Characters (possibly some of the best looking for the PS3's first year)

3.0,True,"08 7, 2013",ANUXCX8I7HYN7,B008XMSRKC,Evildead11,"Remember Me has a great idea for a game.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really capitalize on it.  The premise is interesting and the story could've been so much more.  It felt like a game that was being developed by a team of very talented people, but with a deadline that stunted the quality of their work.

For starters, the game is very pretty.  The backdrop of a futuristic France was really something to behold - from the slums to the nicer parts of the city, everything had a great look to it.  The problem is, I wanted to explore the great looking city and I really couldn't.  The path you must follow is very linear.  Even the platforming portions of the game were linear in that arrows pointed out where you needed to jump to.  This is a very ""a to b"" type of game.

Although the game looked great, the sounds are a different story.  Now, the voice acting was ok.  And, at first, the ambient sound seemed just fine.  Until I played on for a while.  The sounds from different areas tend to repeat themselves over and over again.  In some cases, those sounds were very annoying, too.  Listening to some crazy person spout off his craziness over and over and over again until I reached a certain area was bothersome.  Not a gamekiller, just a little annoying.

What really kept this game from being better than only 3 stars is the combat.  The combo system doesn't work all that well.  Long strings of combos can be very difficult to pull off when you are being attacked by 10 different types of enemies from all sides.  Not to mention the fact that some enemies are ""protected"" by others, meaning there is an order in which you must defeat them.  The whole thing is just more of a bother than it is fun.

There are a few memory sequences that are very well done and fun to execute, but they are very far and few between and have little impact on the game as a whole.

Bottom line is this - it's not a terrible game.  You might have a little fun bouncing around futuristic France if you have a great deal o patience to deal with the various irritants throughout the game.  For me, this is an average game at best.  Don't pay more than $30.00 for it.

I love RPGs in particular and have played many easy and hard RPGs through to completion.  I can honestly say, this is the worst RPG that I've ever bothered to finish.

I see a lot of glowing reviews by gushing fans.  I'm glad you enjoyed the game.  I might have loved it a few decades ago, but it's sub-par by today's standards.  The graphics are cutting edge circa 1987 -- 2D sprites that shake when you hit them in combat.  Combat is menu-driven and slow.  Worse, like many old school RPGs, combat surprises you out of nowhere unavoidably, and is completely repetitive and mind-numbingly boring.  What I wouldn't give for an auto-combat option!  The maze is likewise repetitive and dull.  While there are hundreds of pieces of equipment you can use, they all feel precisely the same, they just flash larger numbers on the screen.  Quests don't correctly remind you what you need to do, so you'll either have to take notes or consult a FAQ if you forget.  The plot is linear and completely predictable.  The game makes no use of touchscreen features aside from drawing a map, which is only required in 2 places.  (You can't use the stylus for menus, inventory, etc.)

But it's not all bad.  I did find the game compelling enough to continue playing.  I enjoy a good timewaster now and again, and there aren't a plethora of excellent DS RPGs.  I particularly enjoyed the music, and I have to admit I enjoyed mapping the game myself rather than using an automap, at least for the first 10 hours or so.  But I only finished the game because of a mildly compulsive nature, not because I loved it.  I didn't recommend this game to any of my RPG-playing friends.

You can enjoy this game, but know what you're getting into first.  It's long, it's tedious, it's repetitive, and it can be hard at times.  There are no huge adrenaline rushes or major plot twists.  Also, I have some recommendations that might improve your gameplay experience:
* Don't overlevel!  It makes the game profoundly boring.
* Hold down A to go faster through combat.
* Invest heavily in the skill that reduces combat frequency.
* Skip past the FOEs and come back later, otherwise you'll overlevel.

Developed by Monolith studios and released in 2005, F.E.A.R.'s story revolves around a Special Forces team who investigates and contains paranormal phenomena. You play as a new but nameless member of the F.E.A.R. team called in to eliminate a cannibalistic killer named Paxton Fettel who controls an army of cloned supersoldiers. After Fettel seizes control of a technology corporation building and murders all inside it's up to the F.E.A.R. team to capture or eliminate him by any means necessary. Here are my thoughts on F.E.A.R.;

Pros

+ Excellent gunplay mechanics and guns are a lot of fun to shoot.

+ Clever and well done A.I.. Enemies flank, duck, cover, vault objects and work as a team to eliminate you.

+ Save anytime, anywhere.

+ Supports a good amount of Widescreen resolutions.

+ Great graphics for a 2005 title.

+ Bullet Time/Slow-Mo was extremely well done.

Cons <Contains SPOILERS>

- Extremely repetitive and bland environments. Endless trudging through sewers, office buildings, steam tunnels, construction sites, warehouses and labs.

- Rather limited number of enemy types.

- Convoluted story that's easily forgotten. All you need to remember is there's a p*ssed off paranormal girl trying to kill you.

- Not really scary at all. Scares are quickly diminished when you begin to receive communication interference, heralding something spooky is going to happen. Really cuts down the eerie tension factor of the game.

- Enemy banter and cursing become repetitive and annoying.

- Lackluster and uninspired score fails to add to the overall environment of the game.

- No real challenging boss fights, just a few tougher mobs from time to time.

- Checkpoint Saves black out and pause your screen for several seconds.

- Lone Wolf approach that your team directs is completely unnecessary. Often you're not even separated yet they tell you to go ahead on your own. Why?

- Predictable and bland ending.

In the end F.E.A.R. was disappointing. Perhaps I was expecting more because of all the media this game received when it was released and the fact they just released F.E.A.R. 3. I was especially let down in the little to no scares the game failed to produce. I've played plenty of Survival Horror type games and F.E.A.R. didn't deliver anything new. One of my other big gripes with the game is the continuous and repetitive environments which made the game go on and on. F.E.A.R. had a few fun moments and the gunfights were often fast and frantic but by the end I was glad the game was over.","F.E.A.R. = F.P.S. that's sometimes good, but never great",1317686400,,,

NBA Live has turned into Triple Play Baseball!

So let's see this game as it is... as in... not final fantasy. Before they came in ATL through ATL III tied in so well. As a matter of fact you would swear ATL and ATL II were the same game, only a continuation. This game doesn't exactly do this... sure there are references to make you know that the other games haven't been completely forgotten but it just doesn't tie in as well as the others. As a matter of fact we have some variation in enemy's names and towns which stayed the same on the games 1-3. This will disappoint people who have played and loved (like me) the first games. People who haven't played any of the games from the Arc series won't catch the references to the earlier games and may enjoy it more thanks to the lack of disappointment. I am not saying anyone who has played the early games wont' enjoy this game, it is a good game. Graphics are excellent (that's right Chris the graphics were EXCELLENT). But as we all know. Graphics don't the game. It is almost essential that an RPG has a good story and this one has a very good one. It is pretty original, and the way we see both sides of the story was absolutely genius. The dialogue was good, besides Kharg's cheesy lines (I just consider it part of his personality) and the voices are awesome. As in all the ATL games the battle's a good one, it's debatable if the battle system has been improved or not, but it's still an awesome system. The characters are awesome, especially on the Demios side.

At first I was terribly excited.  A high quality, exciting opening cutscene, plenty of gameplay options, a variety of characters, some known and some new, to play as...what more could you ask.  So I started playing.  There are four play modes:  Hunt-a-droid, in which you run around trying to kill as many droids as possible within three minutes, battle, in which you face off against up to four opponents for one round, high-stakes in which you face off against one opponent and win lots of money, and then the main game -- tournament mode, where you go through four rounds for each character, destroying enemies and unlocking the more powerful vehicles.  There are a cool selection of power-ups, guns, etc..., and the graphics look nice (except for some draw-in distance issues).  The sound is also great.  But the vehicles aren't that well balanced, and some of the arenas pop up over and over while others are rarely selected by the computer.
This game was very addictive for a few days.  I beat the tournaments, unlocked all the secret characters, made and broke high scores -- and by the third day of gameplay I was bored out of my mind.

The biggest problem with this game (in my mind) is the AI (artificial intelligence), or the lack thereof. The players of your team are slowly jogging around, while the oponent's strikers are about to score (and the game doesn't give you the option to switch to that player, because a mid-fielder is closer to the striker, but too far behind to tackle...).
While the gameplay is pretty good overall, it is extremely frustrating to receive a goal or two because the AI messed up. Every time the oponent runs towards my goal, and all my defenders rush forward, leaving the (often incompetent) goalie all by himself, I could bite into my controller.
There are similar problems with the offensive play. Too often, great chances are missed, because the other strikers decide to run back towards the mid field, forcing you to dribble towards the goalie, which doesn't usually work out very well.
I like EA games. They have set the standards especially with their sports games. But lately, they have been very disappointing. No true xBox support (I would buy a PlayStation, if I wanted PlayStation games...), and very often, attention to detail is lacking. While the moves the players make are fantastic, and the offensive AI of the computer oponent is good, some simply things have simply been messed up. How hard can it be to make players run towards the oponent when they get into the penalty area? How hard can it be to make the players move towards the ball, rather than away?

No. It's incredibly middle-of-the-road. In a lot of ways, it disappoints. In others, it succeeds. Your mileage will vary depending on the circumstances of your gameplay experience. This review endeavors to provide an objective review for anyone on the fence about Mario Party 10.

Before jumping right in, I have a significant cautionary note for everyone. If I'm wrong, someone please correct me and I'll edit my review accordingly, but in my playing the game, I believe I am correct at this point barring an update. If you do not have an amiibo, you cannot play Amiibo Party. Bowser Party is playable using the GamePad. However, the traditional Mario Party mode is ONLY playable using Wii remotes. If you do not have any, you cannot play the game. The GamePad is only useable for limited sections.

The point is that for most purposes, THIS GAME REQUIRES THE USE OF Wii REMOTES. The Wii U Pro Controller is not functional at all with this title.

GAMEPLAY
In early1999, Mario Party released in North America on the Nintendo 64. Billed as a board game come to life in a digital format, Mario Party was a surprisingly fun, addictive party game that could be enjoyed even in single player. Four players were always required for the various boards, but those slots could be filled by CPU-controlled players or other party-goers in real life. The following year, Mario Party received a sequel, the aptly-titled Mario Party 2. Then in 2001, one of the final games released for the Nintendo 64 was Mario Party 3, which more or less built upon those aspects set forth in the original two (though the first two games were generally recognized as being better).

Fast-forward 16 years from the original release of Mario Party. This is the tenth console iteration and there have been three portable versions on the GBA, DS, and 3DS over the last roughly ten years. Mario Party 10 eschews a lot of the aspects that made the early games so fun, but it feels like more of an iteration and less of a revolution.

At its core are 3 main modes plus a set of additional mini-games. First, there's Amiibo Party mode, which requires the use of an amiibo figure. Only certain figures work here, but whether you have a Mario from the Super Mario Bros. series or the Smash Bros. Mario, you can get the same functionality. Amiibo Party mode is more akin to the traditional Mario Party boards where you move individual characters around and engage in games with them.

Mario Party mode is very similar to Mario Party 9. All of the characters jump in a vehicle and move together around the board. Whichever character rolled the die will suffer or benefit depending on the space upon which the vehicle lands (for the most part--sometimes there is an advantage or disadvantage to everyone). The boards are necessarily quite linear. You progress from the beginning to the end along a mostly straight line without too much in terms of choice. Every now and then, you play a mini-game. Some of the mini-games are a lot of fun; others fall flat. It's a fairly typical selection of game types, but there are some unique ones in the mix.

In my personal experience, the most fun part of the game is Bowser Party mode. It limits the amount of stage options, which is a terrible design choice, but it boils down to the player who is using the Wii U GamePad controlling Bowser and the other player(s) controlling the characters in the vehicle. The characters are trying to get to the end of the board, and Bowser is perpetually chasing them. If he catches up to them, a mini-game ensues, but these games are designed to allow the player controlling Bowser to steal other players' hearts. If a character runs out of hearts, he or she is eliminated until such time as the group manages to acquire more hearts, usually from landing on a space that awards them. If all four players are eliminated, Bowser wins. It is a lot of fun, and the person playing as Bowser gets to add a lot of strategy to his or her play style in trying to target certain characters to eliminate them.

The remaining games in Mario Party 10 are a workable version of badminton, a match-4 puzzle game that is more addictive than it has any right to be, a competition with Bowser Jr., and the option to play through a bunch of mini-games. It's all functional, and some of it is fun.

GRAPHICS
Mario Party 10 is bright and colorful. The graphics lack some of the detail found in recent titles like Smash Bros., but they work for this game. At the same time, the HD visuals do not seem to add too much that the SD Wii ones had in Mario Party 8 and 9.

SOUND
Mario Party soundtracks are hit-or-miss. Personally, the highest on my list is the soundtrack for the first game, many of the songs from which I can still hum to this day. There is nothing inherently wrong with the music, but its quality is a distinct step down from Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Super Mario 3D World, and other recent first-party Wii U games.

SUMMARY
After several hours with Mario Party 10, my feelings are very much mixed. It is fun and functional, but at the same time, it falls short in many ways. The Wii U has been the home of many quality titles, but unfortunately, this one is far from the apex of Wii U software. For short bursts or for a party with a lot of people who are willing to play it, the game is fun. Otherwise, it is a good way to spend a weekend and not much else. And of course, stay far away if you traded in or otherwise discarded your old Wii-motes because you cannot even play the game without them.","Mario keeps the party going, but is it out of steam?",1427068800,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii U'}",
3.0,False,"08 25, 2011",AHL35XZ3OND2Z,B002BSA20M,Amazon Customer,"Having taken a break from Halo for a Looooong time, I caved on this finally.

It's Halo.  That's either a good or bad thing, depending on who you are.  In short its pretty much the same Halo as the old one was.  But games have moved on in the time since and with choices like Portal 2 out there, FPS games like this look a bit rusty.  Reach is clearly targeted to a younger crowd and thats not a bad thing.  It sort of is the anti Gears of War.  There are no continuous barrage of F Bombs or decapitations, so its nice to see  something less explicit now and then.  The real problem lies in the simplistic gameplay - if you press jump and hold right trigger, you'll get to the end. There is also no real sense of urgency or structured pacing. I think Bungie is tired of Halo.  I've also been told how the battles are now made like a ""sandbox game.  Not really.  It isn't necessarily scripted, but on the flip side, you can just walk to the next checkpoint without firing a shot sometimes. Also, play the original Crysis - a relatively old game by now - THAT is an open world where point A to point B can be what you want it to be.

Reach is not a bad game - as far as FPS goes, it is more worked out than the COD crap that gets kicked out every year,  but it just feels empty and unfinished.  The graphics aren't that great and despite the simple asthetic, there are some pretty awful frame drops and stuttering.  When you exit the base toward the end of Mission 3, the game almost comes to a standstill from slowdown - which is unforgiveable at this stage in the 360 lifespan. It reminds me of Mega Man 2 and older NES games when there was too much on the screen.  This is 2011 people.  The MP is fun, but like COD, you face serious pwnage starting at a low rank.  Firefight is fun, at least the first few times, but by design, it is repetitive.  Also, survival modes are in pretty much every FPS or third person action game on Xbox or PS3 these days - Firefight, Horde, Survival in UC2, or CoD Zombies - you name it.  The single player difficulty is pushed mostly by limited ammo drops and mega bullet resistant enemies, but everything is so wide open, you can just run away most of the time your shields get red.  The longest part of the game really is the last chunk of levels, where you are basically placed in a ""Firefight"" mode again and again for the finale that drags on and on as you are led into near endless waves of enemies until it's finally over - lazy game design.  The story is dull for 99% of the time, but the after credits ending is by far the best of any installment to date.  Not quite a full redemption, but it's good.  Noble 6 got my respect.

To be more optimistic, one could say this is an apology for Halo 2 and Halo 3. Halo 2, by Bungie's own admission being rushed out the door and Halo 3 because it was a backtracking, repetitive piece of crap.  This is the game, in many ways, they should have been. The controls are sharper, the floaty jumps are toned down, there is no senseless backtracking From Halo 1 and 3 and the story actually provides a sense of closure the other games never bothered with. Even then, that is saying a bit too much. Halo had some good ideas and it created a new world to explore, but it really isn't that interesting to me.  Bungie did a simplistic space marine riff on Half-Life but never went any further. At least by HL 2, Valve ""Evolved"" their gameplay so to speak.  I really hate to down on this, but you aren't missing much here by skipping Reach. I think this is a baby that was both rushed out the door and maybe even unwanted by its parents. This is not Bungie's best work. Ten years later not much has improved.  Midway through, I had flashbacks of when I first played through Halo and the same time I was playing through Metroid Prime.  The differences between the games are big - albeit different genres.  Every time I fired up my Xbox, I could never get over how you really don't do much in Halo other than press the right trigger. That's so 1993.

3.0,True,"12 22, 2011",A6SOVN5MGTFOA,B0012S3X2Q,Daniel S.,"So I bought Legendary solely for the concept, despite the awful reviews I'd seen on here. Why? Because the premise interested me a lot. Pandora's Box holding all the creatures now regarded as myth, mixed with liberal application of heavy ordinance? That was worth four bucks.

However, the developers had a clear target and they couldn't have missed it harder. The game looks awful. When the textures aren't simply failing to load (leaving the models looking like mannequins), the graphics look mediocre at best, and I swear they forgot to edit in the character's head in one cutscene.

The writing is bland, although I didn't expect much, but the story is oddly compelling, even if it does leave an awful lot untold and leaves things wide open for a sequel that we'll probably never see. The characters are mediocre, the girl who is worked up to be the love interest is totally dismissed, and the main protagonist is bland as can be, and somehow has a mastery of any weapon he can get his hands on, despite supposedly being only an art thief.

However, it's the gameplay that manages to even partly save this. While things are extremely linear, it's actually rather fun, despite some controls being a bit odd (having to hold down a button to aim, rather than simply press a button) and some match-ups being so hopelessly uneven (taking on a gryphon with a shotgun? A minotaur with an assault rifle? Those two were real pains to get through) and the checkpoints being seemingly at random points. Sure, they only roll out six or seven types of non-human opponents (firedrakes, werewolves in two flavors, gryphons, minotaurs, echidnae from greek mythology, two asian-mythology creatures, both of which are annoying as hell to fight, and the kraken for something desperately trying to resemble a boss-fight) but that actually helps, as it prevents you from getting bogged down trying to figure out which two weapons you'll need most desperately in this level.

What really lets this game down is the story. They try to work it up as society crumbling to make things seem more dramatic and desperate, but we don't really see evidence of this, and although I shouldn't expect as much from an indie game, it comes off as overly hammed up at times. The unskippable cutscenes get to be a real pain, but it doesn't detract from the game too much. The entire thing ends rather abruptly with a final battle that totally failed to make me care at all, and winds up with a total anti-climax.

All in all, it's a decent game that could have been great if it'd had a little more time and money behind it. For four bucks, it's well worth it.",Great concept...awful execution.,1324512000,2,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Then, the game was ported to the PS3 with no major changes except the developers made the game not as insanely hard as it was on the X360 version.. Anyway, I played the game for the first time a couple days ago and beat it yesterday. The story is about a AIB stealth team is sent into a city to rid the city of Vampires, but are known as Nightwalkers. The city is infested with Nightwalkers and you are trying to neutralize them and take out the Prime Walkers. There are only 4 teammates. You are one of them known as John Lloyd and is the most experienced out of the group when it comes to nightwalkers. And that's all I will say So far, I have a mixed opinion about the game, but here are the pros and the cons. I listed 12 Pros and 12 Cons.

Pros:
-Ultimate stealth experience.
-Very challenging and rewarding.
-Characters are interesting.
-Nice rain effects.
-The dialogue can relieve some of the tension in the game.
-The map radar is accurate and helps point you in the right direction.
-The concept and idea of a stealth game with vampires is original.
-It's the first game of its kind.
-Story is decent.
-Very Lengthy Single-Player campaign.
-When you complete the campaign, you will feel very accomplished.
-Repay value is high.

Cons:
-Requires a lot of patience.
-Very frustrating at times when you keep getting killed cheaply
-The voice acting is acceptable, but at times is in need of improvement
-Boss fights are pathetically easy, but not creative at all.
-Controls are annoying and clunky.
-Graphics are not terrible, but not very good either.
-Two hits and your dead; One hit by a vampire knocks you down, then one more hit kills you instantly.
-Insane difficulty even at Normal difficulty setting.
-Nobody plays online.
-Weapon selection is very limited.
-Every gun is almost useless except the Shotgun and Sniper Rifle.
-Your team does almost nothing to help you.

POP is pretty standard regardless of what game you are playing, jumping, puzzles, etc. Voice acting is okay too.

Finished WW...sort of. One of the hallmarks of this series is the play-die-play-get a little farther-die-repeat process.

Fast-forward to today.  Rockstar games is under pressure to sell out to EA Games (the mindless zombie gamemaker that will own all video games by the end of days), and has been resisting until the release of GTAIV.

Rockstar should have sold out.  It would have been a chance for EA to review GTAIV and MAYBE stopped it before it was too late.

This game seems...forced.  I am a Russian fresh off the boat complete with annoying accent that sounds like ""I am toolking veeth da bouldars in da mou-tah.""  I have to listen to the ""F"" word about sixty times in the opening credits of the game.  I have to hear the word TEEETIEEES and have them described as ""like MEHLOHNS"".

I like boobies as much as the next guy...but come on...I really don't want to hear some borscht slurping sack of crap describe them in a WAY over-done cutscene about ""LIFE IN AMER-R-R-REEEKA"".  Well, GUESS WHAT, BORIS!?  R-R-R-R-R-Ruffles have R-R-R-R-R-R-Ridges, mofo, and I'd rather eat a whole bag than pay $60 for this overhyped piece of crap!  This isn't the 1940's anymore.  Everyone KNOWS that America is just about as overhyped as this video game!  I LOVE America with all of my heart...but I was born and raised here and have all of the amenities of this country being my home.  Basically...if you come over here be ready to bag my groceries or drive the taxi that takes me where I need to go because the American dream doesn't really exist anymore for you.

Anyway...the storyline is forced upon you as if you'd gone out to buy a new sportscar to drive around and have fun in...but then you open the glove box and find out that you MUST use the car to go certain places.  If you don't then there is an ANNOYING beeping that will go off in random intervals to annoy the crap out of you.  Yeah...I'm talking about the cell phone.  WHERE'S THE OFF BUTTON!?

Listen up, Rockstar.  The little fanboys and kiddies (who shouldn't be playing this anyway) are going to bow down before you and talk about how l33t this game is and how it is so great...but you and I...we know the truth.

The real truth is that somewhere along the line this franchise got old and tired...but still worked.  You felt the need to improve upon something that was already great and you screwed it up.  Dates!?  Is this GRAND THEFT AUTO...or is this the Sims - Real Life?  I want to steal cars, run over pedestrians, and shoot police officers...I do NOT want to go bowling with an annoying Mid-West chick (I live in St. Louis...there are PLENTY of those around here).

Anyway...another over-hyped OKAY game for the X-Box 360.  If you're expecting something amazing...try again (unless you're 12...and then the strip club scenes will seal the game for you as teh numberest oneest EVAR!)

TEEEETIIIIES!!!!

Edit:  After playing this game a bit more...I would like to add something.

I think the previews for this game should have been edited slightly to be as follows...

A car pulls up and parks.  Niko gets out of the car and, gun in hand, walks in slow motion up to a man who is facing the other direction...

A voiceover begins (with a crappy Russian accent)...  *I am new here to Amereeka...eet ees strange cauntree...  I have bought peepel...sold peepel...keeled peepel...I am mercenaree...I keel for mahnee...*

Niko then raises the gun and...

The scene blinks and Niko has no gun in his hand at all.  He yells, ""Hey...you peese of sheet...Broocie told me to keeel you so that is why I am here...to keel you weeth a gun...the gun here in my pants!""

Guy yells, ""[...]!"" and runs over and jumps in a crappy car.

Niko then, in slow motion, tries to get a gun out but heaven reaches down to the rusty beat-up Pinto that the target has jumped into and turns it into a rocketship that zooms offscreen faster than any other car in the game.

Niko runs over, getting stuck on some pedestrians and a tree, knocks over a hot dog stand, and then gets into his car that is now facing a completely different direction.  He has to back up and move forward for a 10 point turn before he can get to chasing the bad guy, who is still flying at well over 200 mph in a rusty beat-up Pinto...until finally the guy reaches 10 of his buddies and God ceases to empower his Pinto with the fires of heaven.

The voiceover finishes...  *Yes...Amereeka ees strange country.  My car...eet moves by eetself and I must warn evereeone here before I keel them if it is relevant to thee storeeline...but I am now an expert in thee game of darts and can heet bullseye every time.*",Hooray for overhype!,1209686400,9,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Its basically Grand Theft Auto/Hackers the movie. There are a lot of puzzles thrown into the mix, but even those are fun. The only thing I found annoying is that the game can be unfair when you're trying to sneak, sometimes. You can surprise a guard with a taser shot, line it up right and quickly take him out, but for some reason, the whole building will be notified that you're on the premise. The guard didn't even have time to radio for help! Sometimes sneaking works perfectly, sometimes its unfair. Still a good game though!

I liked this game so don't get me wrong here but I could not bring myself to buy it.  I rented it from Gamefly to try it out and I will have to say it surprised me.  I read a lot of previews before the game came out and I didn't expect to enjoy the gameplay as much as I did but I couldn't put it down.  The one reason I didn't buy is its not the type of game I would own since I don't see its staying power as far as me going back to it and playing over and over.  If I were to buy games based upon what I thought would be the great PS3 games than this would go in there.  I did notice there were a lot of parallels to Indigo Prophecy but I am glad there was nothing of a supernatural essence in it.  First off I will say make sure you stay with it since it does start off kind of slow but even with the slow beginning I could not stop trying to change the outcome of the mall scene.  Me being a father it kind of made me think about my own kids and how if something like that happened I would replay it in my mind constantly.  I even looked over at my wife while the scene took place and could tell it was shaking her up.  I will have to say they pulled the beginning off for me and kind of set the tone of the game.  I knew that since the beginning pulled me in like that than I might be in for a treat.  The overall story moves slow and I think I would of like two characters over the four but wow they pulled it off for me and now I am glad they made it that way.

As far as music goes I absolutely loved it especially when something tense is going on to make the mood more intense.  The animation is kind of stiff since they kind of walk like robots and the kissing and making out looks kind of funny but I was more engrossed in the story to really care that much.  The controls are pretty good and I found that though it took a while to get use to I still enjoyed the game.  My wife is not a gamer and I think its simple enough she could play it and thats not necessarily a bad thing.  I found by the end I was thinking about all my decisions I had made and how things might of turned out differently so I really think what the creators were going for did its job.  I will need to say this but my friend at work told me that his favorite game of all time is COD MW 2 and I don't think he would like this type of game as much.  This is a game that I hope is the future of story telling for games and interaction as well.  Though MW2 may be a good game I am a big fan of almost any genre so I found it a welcome change.  Just do yourself a favor and don't expect guns blazing.  I found this a game I could set down with my wife and play and be completely engrossed in a way that I have not been in this generation of games.  Believe me I am close to twenty eight as of this review and have been gaming for about twenty four of that and I would have to say this is one I will remember for years to come.  Your whole life comes down to little and big decisions and the game pulled it off in the time that I was in that world.

The game left me wanting more and I found myself with questions to unanswered parts of the game but now I find out there is dlc planned so that makes it o.k. with me. There are already plenty of reviews for this game so I won't go into mentioning what others have so I would say at least rent it and you might be surprised like I was.

To make it all that much better, they don't shove the same tired old ""fight the uber enemy"" like they do with Mass Effect, as the tone changes from ""fight the darkspawn"" to ""deal with the mage/templar situation"".  But you know, every game has a big weakness of some sort and Dragon Age 2 isn't any different. What they make up in everything else, they lack in proper inventory handling. Rather then distribute equipment to your party memebers, you are stuck with the protagonist (Hawke) being the only one to use the various armor pieces that drop, with everyone else only being able to equip the weapons and jewelry. Bioware was even wise in how they handle importing the events of Dragon Age: Origins, allowing you to choose your own saved game or use one of three pre-established backgrounds and unlike a certain space opera that we all know, each background varies in some ways.

The headset is built sturdy, and comes with a protective case.  Everything feels very comfortable, and durable.  My favorite part of the headphones is the sound quality.  The sound quality on these headphones is AMAZING! Everything sounds crystal clear, and I hear things in games that I never heard before through other headsets/speakers. In addition, the headset manages to give you the full surround experience so things that are behind you sound like they are behind you.  The sound quality on these things is unbeatable.

With all my compliments about the device, you are probably wondering why I gave it 4 stars.  Well first of all, the install was very annoying.  I am installing this on my brand new gaming computer, and the whole process from cd insert to final boot up after installing everything took about a half hour.  Also, for some reason you have to type in an activation key before you can use the headphones.  Seems sort of silly to think somebody is going to try and ""pirate"" headphone driver software...  As with most installs these days, the CD also wanted to install some sort of media ad/spyware bar to my Internet Explorer as well (which I declined).  The other thing that bugs me would have to be the ease of use.  With all the software I installed for these things, it would be nice if when I plug them in the sound just transfers to them, and when I unplug, the sound goes back to the speaker.  Rather, you have to go to control panel and change your default sound output each time.

Aside from some ""interface"" issues, these headphones are simply amazing.  If you are looking for a nice set of gaming headphones, I'd say this is a fairly reasonable price for the quality that you are getting with these.","A few minor problems, but great sound and build quality",1219622400,,,

Graphics does get to 60fps and is smooth at max settings.  You can also download a ton of campaigns and add-ons from CombatAce.

Regarding this XP version:

It's very AIM-7E Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder centric as per the era.

This game is entertaining enough.  The planes look great.  It's light and easy compared to sims like Falcon 4.0, Falcon 4.33 BMS, Lock-On, or DCS.  But, it can't be written off either.  It's not arcade-style in that the flying and combat look authentic.

4.0,False,"09 27, 2004",A3SZ1QS1O6QY6X,B0002ILSIS,Team Noodles,"This year's game brought some really interesting stuff to the table. You start the game by racing against Ryan Newman in a street race. You, then, create your own profile. The game includes the Alliance/Rivalry feature from last year's game. You can build alliances with drivers by sharing your draft with them, and in THIS year's game, you can take it one step further with the intimidator feature. Using this feature, you can now get right up behind another driver, and in many cases, cause them to lose control of their car.

The way Thunder Plates are unlocked is great. In previous games, Thunder Plates were unlocked (at random) by simply completing Lightning Challenges. This year, you can actually BUY Thunder Plates. Thunder Plates are purchased with skill points. You earn skill points by accomplishing certain tasks (such as making 5 allies in one race or making 5 rivals in one race), or by playing Lightning Challenges. You can also earn skill points by simply racing. You get 5 points for every second you lead the race, 7 for every second you're sharing your draft with another driver, 7 when you're intimidating another driver, 12 for every time you make a clean pass, and even more if you start out farther back in the pack and make it into the top 5 and, of course, 1st place.

The game also includes last year's Speedzone Challenge. This mode is great for brushing up on your various skills. The different challenges include drafting, passing, blocking, and more.

In addition to Nextel Cup racing, you will find the Craftsman Truck series, Busch series (referred to as ""NASCAR National series""), and even the Modified series. The game also includes production cars and allows for some street racing.

There are also fantasy road courses in the game from last year. The Docks, Devil's Canyon, and New York are just a few.

The controls for NASCAR 2005 are also a lot smoother and more forgiving. It almost seemed as though in last year's game, one would find themselves very dependent on driving assists. In this year's game, making mistakes won't cost you the race.

Graphically, 2005 is overall impressive. The framerate is, however, more varied. Going down the back stretch, you will find the framerate is very solid, and very smooth (even when the rear view mirror is on). Going into the turns and a few other random spots, you will find the framerate drops drastically. Also, reviving one feature from Thunder 2002, when you start a night race, you will see the sun setting in an orange sky. By the end of the race, even on 8%, you will see the sky is totally dark.

Now, the bad news and the reason I give the game 4 stars instead of 5. If I could, I would actually give this game 3.5 stars. Anyway, NASCAR 2005 is missing quite a few drivers. Even in the Nextel series, Jeremy Mayfield and Ken Schrader are missing! Pocono Raceway is missing! As mentioned by someone else, there are several Busch and Craftsman drivers missing. That truly takes something away from the game. Another thing is the ability to create a new car and create a name for each driver of each created car. Whatever info you use to create your profile in Fight to the Top mode will be the info applied to every car you create.

Overall, this year's game isn't bad. With all the extra modes, the game's playability will stay longer. However, hardcore NASCAR fans will be disappointed to see drivers and tracks missing.",Could've Been Better,1096243200,12,,

The Bad: Too much talking, not enough playing, not for action fans, a few obscure puzzles

I played the sequel awhile ago but I had know idea it was a sequel. Now that I played this game I'm glad I did because it has one of the most unique and interesting stories in gaming history. There are two worlds known as Stark and Arcadia which is the world of science and magic. Stark is out world and Arcadia is stuck in the medieval times. A girl named April Ryan has been chosen to save both worlds from the Vangaurd, who are people trying to convince both worlds towards their religion. A divide was created between both worlds to keep the Balance in check.

While this game is NOT for action fans it has A LOT of talking and not much playing. While there are the occasional obscure puzzles, the game is fairly easy. The only people who should play this game are people who LOVE stories. The pre-rendered graphics are decent and the price is just right ($10 on Steam!).

You can also see the AI limitations, the guard on 2nd floor walks a loop from bathroom to bedroom to office and back. His says the same thing over and over, and when your in the shadows he can't seem to see you crouching 2 feet away. If I would've stood he would have seen me though. he also doesn't seem to notice I left the dresser door wide open. They will notice closed doors or if you hit light switch. I could've killed him but its more fun to sneak around him, plus you get more money for not killing or being detected (trophy for finishing game without a kill as well).

Thief is a game about stealing things (I know that's stating the obvious). If you are looking for an action packed ""shoot 'em up"" type of game this one isn't for you. This game is about sneaking around, avoiding enemies and staying in the shadows. The point is to not get into open combat. They made this game so that your pretty weak and it takes a lot of swings to knock out a guard in combat (if you sneak up behind them when not in combat you can knock out in 1 hit though). At the end of each level there is a ""grading"" on how stealthy you were (similar to Splinter Cell, if you weren't detected and didn't kill/knockout anyone you are graded ""Ghost"", if you throw objects and use surroundings you get a grade of ""opportunist"" etc).

The graphics are very good but not great. You get drawn into this dreary city. I thought the small details were good, like scrapped up stone at placed where you use your hook to climb up, rain makes the stone look slick. After a while the constant night gets old. I realize he is a thief and he should only operate at night but a change of scenery would've been nice. Also besides Garrett, the characters in the cutscenes look more like cartoonish rather than realistic (not ps4 quality). The voice audio couldve been much better and many of the guards just keep saying the same thing over and over again.

Gameplay is good. This is one of the few games that actually uses the touchpad on the PS4 controller (used for inventory). Lock picking seems really simple at first but the locks get tougher as you go on and when your picking a safe next to a sleeping guard you don't want to mess it up (getting lock pick wrong makes a loud click noise). The AI isn't the greatest but they do get smarter on the more difficult settings. On Normal (thief) setting you wonder how people don't know your stealing things from their desk drawers while they sit at the fireplace. You are armed with a bow and a variety of arrows, but again the point is not to shoot your way out of trouble. You use arrows to extinguish torches (easier to hide in shadows/darkness), and to shoot ropes to climb up, etc. The stealing element is really fun. Imagine hiding trying to sneak up behind a guard to steal his money off his belt without him noticing as he patrols around a jewelry store. steal able items will glitter and you can check nearly every dresser or drawer for more loot. Hardest part of the game in my opinion is trying to complete an entire mission stealing 100% without being detected at all.

While the game is not truly open world and it can get linear at times, there are times when there are multiple ways to get your objective. For example at the jewelry store on the first chapter there are multiple ways to get to the store and multiple ways to get inside the store (there is a basement door, and a first floor door and a ""duct"" you can go through). Between missions you have free run of the city. Its a bit annoying that the main gates to the different sections of the city are closed off so you have to waste a ton of time finding an alternate route. The map sucks, and nothing is labeled on it. To find the merchant you don't go to a storefront, you just talk to some random guy outside a tavern. He isn't listed on the map, and no one in game ever mentions him, you just have to stumble into him. One guy... in an entire city....

On a small note, this game is rated mature. So if a few nudity scenes offend you then you may want to pass. There is an entire chapter in a brothel afterall. Which is fine by me but if your a parent you might want to know about that before buying.

If your into games that require some thought or sneaking around like Splinter Cell, Outlast, or dishonored you will probably like this game.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that when I bought the game it didn't work initially. When i put the disc in it would attempt to load it for about 6 seconds then take me back to PS4 home screen. Sony customer service was no help since they kept telling me to delete the game from ""application saved data mgmt"" screen but there was no game data there. I did get it to play after going into ""system storage mgmt"" and selecting applications and deleting the game info there. After that the game worked.","More sneaking less combat, very solid game",1393545600,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

First off, you need an internet connection for this game to work. Next, you'll need Xbox Live for multiplayer. Visually, Steep looks great. The sky/sun glare, the mountains, the way the snow reacts and crumbles to the board or characters movements is just plain awesome. But get up close to the trees or the ice and you'll feel like your playing 1080 on the N64. You do have some options with the clothes you wear and your board but I didn't bother too much with that. Each event is fun and offers a nice challenge, some events you'll find yourself replaying a few times to beat but nothing that makes you rage out or get frustrated with. Free-roaming the mountains is a blast and allows you to take in some visually pleasing scenes while exploring different terrain and learning new tricks naturally. Which is a good thing because the controls are a bit wonky and take some getting used to.

Pros:
-Scenery is visually pleasing and sets the mood and tone for each area of the map really well.
-Character clothing options are pretty good.
-The sound of snow crushing beneath your board or skies, the sound of the wind as you fly, the ambient sounds of the woods really help pull the player into the game.
-Achievements aren't terribly hard to get.

C'mon everyone is this game really that bad???  The answer is NO.  The NAME is terrible, we mostly can agree on that. The GAME is Fine & even Dandy.
  The Gameplay is great, in fact the best I've ever experienced with EA Golf games, now i've missed the last 2 installments, but to me Tiger 2011 & Tiger (The Masters) 2012 were outstanding and of the very best.
Is Rory PGA Tour as good?  Probably not when it's all said and done.  Is it an acceptable addition to the next Gen sports library...I SAY YES.

Regarding the Gameplay I love the option of switching between several different modes including Arcade and Classic.  Good move.  I prefer Arcade but I love the options of switching and the tutorials for this are solid.
The Graphics are lovely, not a significant increase while in the actual gameplay modes, but definitely better than ever.  The cut scenes look absolutely stunning, and you can even see some fun details like animals on the fairway or in the woods, or even in the swamp...such as a hungry gator - the same one that got Chubbs Hand!!

I still can't believe IGN only gave this game a 5.5 out of 10.  I need to play all the modes to make my final decision but so far I'm feeling about a 7.5 or 8 out of 10.
Of course I'm hearing rumblings about online gameplay issues which is likely why my rating is so generous.  If that is legit, then I'm sorry to hear but I just don't care.  I'm rather inclined to interact with real friends in a real environment for 'Couch Co Op' , play a few rounds while splitting a case of brew, firing up the grill and also enjoying some 'Golf' Grass.  After all you can't pause the Grill while those Dogs are a Cookin'.

I could go online and play this but I would need an excuse.. like it's too hot to play the real game outside.  I guess that's actually legit right now, but I don't care for online sports gaming, so the single player modes will do for me.

On with the evaluation of Rory for the PS4...YES we all know the Golf character creation is quite simplified and watered down in comparison to previous years.  I too am also disgruntled that my player cannot look Chinese with a hint of African American, Samoan, and Brazilian while sporting long dreadlocks and a Tutu or Skirt.  I do miss this too, but it's not everything to me.  The gameplay is what I expect to enjoy especially with Sports Video games, for this title it's there.
I like the game for what it is, we all know it isn't perfect but please listen to me when I write that it really is NOT as bad as critics are saying.

But, it wasn't and gamers/consumers payed full price for really ugly Triple A titles

RE6 is no way a real survival horror title it's this strange animal (It doesn't know what it wants to be)
You'd think Paul W.S. Anderson wrote this story I'm shocked Alice doesn't pop in and save all the heroes
Everything is so go-go-go and maniac
The people at Capcom must've done boat loads of Scarface coke to write something this scatter brained and all over the place

Graphics/Sound
This is the real RE6 this is the version we should've got out the gate  (This re-release for both the PS4 and XBOne is pretty much the high end PC port of the game)
It looks 5x's better then the previous 360 version everything looks sharp and proper
(The original 360 version was washed-out and just showed the 360 age)
The audio too sounds 10x's better due to the option to decode in DTS 5.1+
(Anyone who doesn't have a decent home theater system for your console get one) gaming trolls love to throw out tech details but, nobody ever talks about the audio good HQ theater sound is just as important as PQ trust me

Controls: feels streamlined for the new controller (The QTE respond much better on this version)

Story: This is where it gets hinky this game was to ambitious for it's own good
This is not a Resident Evil game it has characters from those games thrown into this manic hot mess
The story is all over the place (There are various online guides or FAQ on how to play through this game and actually understand it
If you play it your way the story will collapse all around you
The game is divided into 4 stories with Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller (illegitimate son of Albert Wesker)  and Ada Wong.
at times the stories cross paths and different characters interact
Each character also has a different style of game in a sense (Leon's starting off very much like Classic Resident Evil)
Jake's being a strange updated Beat 'em up and Chris being a horrible Spec Ops: The Line rip-off
Ada's is a mixture of all of them with stealth elements and plenty of annoying puzzles

One of the biggest problems with this game is the quick time events
35-40% of the game uses quick time events and good lord it'll will make you want to jump out of a window

This worth a second go around????
Without a doubt yes especially  if you have Amazon Prime you'll pay $16.00
as much as a massive disappointment this game was back in October '12
It's worth the super cheap SRP for lots of bang for your buck  (Plus you get all the DLC)
Pretend it's just a funky 3rd person action game and you'll be fine.... It's like a Michael Bay film
You can tell there was lots of money put into this game the production values are insane
But, sometimes too much is a bad thing I doubt we'll ever see anything this epic in scale from a Resident Evil game anytime soon
Take it for what it is and don't over analyze it and you'll actually enjoy it for what it's meant to be a epic roller coaster ride

This was wasn't an exception.  I have pre-ordered it and pick it up on the store. I didn't get it from amazon this time. Well, Graphics I will give 5 stars. game play I would give 3.5 stars.  LIke somebody mentioned, unlike other assassin's creed, this one they tried to make the character move more smoothly which caused annoying result. In some areas where you just want to hop over next building, the character would make a 360 spin and end up landing in some weird place.  It is little buggy and it's got to some point where little frustration has happened since when I was playing the online co-op missions, I would just fall between buildings and get stuck inside... or I actually fell good 30 seconds to reach the bottom of the map and get de-synchronized. I really hope the future patch will fix these major problems.  Time to time framerate goes REALLY low like 4~5, but it doesn't last that long but it is still annoying. Online game play can be annoying in a way, if other player is afk, it would not do anything but just kill my time.
Another annoying thing would be to link the mobile to ps4 to open certain specific chests. Which means, in off line with your ps4, or even while you are playing ps4, if you don't want to miss any chest, you would have to play the phone version of assassin's creed which is quiet annoying to do.

The sound quality is very good, they create a very good surround field.  It is nice that it has a toslink fiber optic out.  The biggest advantage for me is the incorporation of the voice chat into the complete experience.  For example, when I play with my normal 5.1 system, the xbox live headset blocks one of my ears making it harder to pick up the game audio.  When you use the headset, you get the gaming audio and stereo voice chat making it easier to interpret the game audio.

4.0,False,"02 27, 2013",A35VJC424AGADX,B0050SY77E,MikeB,"Crysis 3 is a first person shooter. So are about 80% of all video games right now, so Crysis 3 has a ton of competition, and thus has to do something really special to stand out from the crowd. Fortunately, Crysis 3 does enough right to make it worth your time and money.

STORY
You play as Prophet, a man wearing an experimental nanosuit made from Ceph (alien) technology. Prophet's nanosuit gives him super-human powers and abilities, making him humanity's only hope against the impending alien threat. Thrown into the mix are the evil C.E.L.L. agents who are humans trying to harness the alien tech for themselves. The concept isn't terribly original, but it's not poorly done either. The story picks up 30 years after the events of Crysis 2, but you don't have to have played the previous games to follow the story. The characters are fairly well written and interesting, and help to drive the story along. It was certainly easier to follow and more interesting than Crysis 2, anyway.

GAMEPLAY
The basic premise is to shoot enemies and not get shot. What makes Crysis 3 distinct is the nanosuit abilities. In addition to making you faster and stronger than a normal human, the suit also allows you to turn invisible or shield yourself from incoming fire. Added to the usual arsenal of human and alien weapons is a new bow, which can be fired while cloaked and is almost always an instant kill. Because you are so overpowered, this means the C.E.L.L. agents are barely any threat, and the only real challenge comes later in the game against the Ceph aliens. While killing C.E.L.L. agents is fun, they're so helpless against Prophet that I started to feel bad for them. It doesn't help matters that the AI isn't terribly creative. When you stealth kill an enemy, someone will eventually notice and go over to investigate the body, which you can then use to kill another guy. This in turn makes another guy investigate the bodies, and sometimes you can exploit this to kill 4 or 5 guys easy. The Ceph are more aggressive and agile, making them more formidable foes. Some Ceph are heavily armored, making them almost impossible to kill without explosives. Fighting the Ceph is a lot more fun than fighting humans, but sometimes the disparity between the two can be jarring.
The level design in Crysis 3 is a mixed bag. The levels are huge, but sometimes they feel unfocused. I got lost a few times trying to figure out how to get to the next waypoint marker. The path isn't always clear, but the gigantic playgrounds the game gives you allows for a lot of freedom in how you want to play. Nearly every situation has several options, be it sneak, run and gun, or whatever. The problem is that I found using a combo of stealth and bow was the fastest, easiest, and most efficient way to approach nearly every situation. Because of this, the game started to feel a little repetitious, however that was my choice to play that way.
In addition to shooting, there are some vehicle sections, but they weren't very good. The buggy and the tank you drive are really unwieldy, and the flying section only allowed you to control the gun, not the plane. I give them credit for trying to add variety to the gameplay, but the vehicle sections were certainly a low point for the game.
It's hard to describe the experience, because overall it was fun, but there were some minor issues that detracted from the fun and held Crysis 3 from being an incredible experience.

CONTROL
Crysis 3 is a busy game. Literally every button, stick, and pad on the Xbox controller has an important function, and some buttons have two functions, like the Y button which switches between guns, but double tapping Y switches to grenades, or the back button, which brings up the suit upgrade menu when tapped, but brings up the weapon mod menu when held. Having this many buttons to keep track of did get a tad confusing sometimes, usually during heated shootouts. Another minor problem was when the character would keep moving slowly after I let go of the left thumb stick. This is an issue with my controller, not necessarily the game, but since control sticks sometimes have these issues, most games program a ""dead zone"" when the stick is in the neutral position, and some games even allow you to change your controller's dead zone in the options menu. This feature would have been greatly appreciated in Crysis 3. Also, compared to some other FPS games on the X360, Crysis felt a little slippery. Games like CoD and Halo have very tight controls, and movement is very precise, which is something I really like in FPS games. In Crysis 3, however, when you let go of the sticks, your character will continue to move for a half second, seeming to have momentum, rather than coming to a quick stop. Again, this is minor, but when a half second means the difference between a head shot and a miss, it can be annoying.  Besides this minor annoyances, though, the game's controls are very responsive. The guns feel heavy and powerful, the buttons respond consistently and accurately, and you can even change your button layout in the options menu.

GRAPHICS
By far the most impressive aspect of Crysis 3, the graphics are surely pushing the Xbox 360's seven year old hardware to it's limit. Crysis 3 runs on Crytek's CryEngine 3, and it can do nearly every trick in the book. Dynamic lighting and shadows, water, fire, lens flare, motion blur, aperture, normal mapping, particle effects, and on and on. The only thing it doesn't do is tesselation, but that's a limit of the X360, not the game's fault. Crysis 3 is by far the most technically impressive game to run on the X360. But all the cutting edge tech is no good without artistry, and fortunately Crytek's artists are amazing. The crumbling ruins of New York City overgrown with dense foliage look absolutely stunning. Equally stunning are the characters, who are dense with detail and animated superbly. There are scenes where Psycho (a friend of yours) is talking to you, getting emotional over the events that have led him here, and you can see the anger and sadness in his face, in his performance. The visuals in Crysis 3 are so good, they almost look next-gen.

SOUND
The sound in Crysis 3 is LOUD! Everything sounds aggressive, from the aliens and the guns to the vehicles and even the music. Every sound effect is good, it fits well in the context of the game and sounds appropriate to what it represents. Like a Hollywood movie, it may not be the real-life sound effect, but it's what we as an audience have come to expect a blockbuster to sound like. The music is fantastic, and fits the mood well. When all's quiet, the game plays some haunting piano music in the background, and when a firefight breaks out, the music becomes heart-pounding and frantic. The voice actor's performances are also very well done, with Prophet and Psycho being most notable. Some of the raw emotion that Psycho's VA does are really fantastic, and bring realism and weight to the character, even when his dialogue is somewhat cheesy. I did notice some strange SFX at some points in the game, like the sound of glass crunching beneath my feet when there was no glass there. It was rare, but there were some moments where I'd hear something and have no idea why.

OVERALL
Crysis 3 is a really great game, and I would recommend you buy it if you like FPS games. The experience isn't perfect (and I would have liked to see co-op and survival modes), but there are very few shooters better than this one, and from a graphics perspective, this is the best. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. I haven't played the multiplayer, so I can't comment on that, but as for the single player experience, this is one of the best FPS games on the X360.",Campaign Review,1361923200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I bought ""Legends of Terror Collector's Edition"" and ""Mystery Masters Collector's Edition,"" two of several 20 game packs being offered by Viva Media.

The great - each collection offers 20 hidden object adventures for less than 2 bucks a game, most of these games individually go for about $8.00 a pop, and based on other titles by this publisher I've already played (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sacra-Terra-Angelic-Night-Download/dp/B0067N0HLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sacra Terra: Angelic Night [Download</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Encounters-Deadwood-Download/dp/B008BAGU3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Encounters: Deadwood [Download</a>]), the content is uniformly excellent. Some titles do overlap between collections, but for the sheer volume of games you still come out way ahead.

Two of the games, ""House of 1000 Doors: Family Secrets"" and ""Weird Park - Broken Tune"" for example, have storylines that are so daft they can't help but be entertaining. Typical of Viva Media titles, the hidden object scenes are just gorgeous to look at and a delight to play.

The not so great - Others here have warned about installation problems, and unfortunately, I ran into the same thing.  When you insert the disc, you can pick the games you want to install, so as a test, I tried installing  ""House of 1000  Doors: Family Secrets"" and ""Weird Park - Broken Tune"" (one from each separate collection)  on three different computers - Two are older systems running Windows Vista, one is a pretty new machine running Windows 7.  On all three systems, the games took an extremely long time to load - there was a lot of disc chugging, and on my newest computer, I had to force a shutdown reboot and try a second install. Bottom line was with patience, yes, I was able to successfully load both ""test"" games on all 3 computers, but it shouldn't have been this dicey.  Had antivirus running on all machines, but I don't think this was the problem.

Story-You have been called to Hollywood to investigate strange accidents that are happening on the filming of a movie called ""Pharaoh!""  This is a newer version of the film that was produced 75 years before. And on that previous production, the star actress had died because of a fatal accident involving a poisonous snake.  Your goal is to find the culprit of the accidents before someone gets hurt. . .or worse.

Graphics-They are nice, but they aren't 3D.  They are more like very well drawn cartoons, and I really liked them.  The characters are really well-drawn cartoon characters.

Music-Usually the music has an Egyptian feel to it, which I liked.  The voice acting was good and interesting to listen to.

Gameplay-You go from place to place finding objects and putting them together.  For instance, suppose you have to use your flashlight to examine a scene for clues.  So you find batteries for the flashlight only to find that you have to find new bulb.  After you do, you find a piece of paper that needs to be translated, so you go to a minigame to translate it.  You play a lot of minigames that make the game interesting and fun.  There are four characters that you are always running into, and in order to talk to them, you have to select correct responses from a list.  For instance, maybe you want to ask a guy why he had a certain picture in his room.  The options for questions might be to ask why he had that picture, a goldfish, a tv, a gun, or a diary in his room, and you have to select the right question.  They aren't always that easy, though.  The back of the box boasts of an optional ending, but it is really just a continuation of the first ending, so in the game, there is only one true culprit.

Fun-This game is a blast.  You don't really have to use your brain except for a few puzzles, and they aren't that hard.  There are some timed puzzles which I found frustrating, but they weren't that bad.

Length-The reason I took off a star is because of the length.  This game lasts about 3 hours, so it isn't that long at all.  It really doesn't have much replay value, but I will probably still find myself playing it again someday.

All in all, this is a really fun game worthy of your time.  Unfortunately, it doesn't take much of your time.  I do recommend it but only for $10 or less.  I mean, $15-$20 for three hours?  That's not a good deal.",Really short (but fun) seek and find game,1262131200,,,

I think this always skews my review a bit, but there are few games in this world worth $60 in my opinion.  However, Assassin's Creed is like no games in the world, and was very much worth my $29. :-)

Graphically, its outstanding.  Rendered textures and lighting are some of the best and most realistic I've seen on a 360 game.  It got buggy in a few spots, but on a good LCD TV with HDMI inputs, you'll be impressed.  The sound, from the music to the AI ""chatter"" is brilliant, and adds a real cinematic feel to the experience.  I'm gonna sound like a fan-boy here, but having Kristen Bell's voice as a character sweetens the deal. Gameplay is solid, and easy to pick up, and its a helluva lot of fun to climb the highest church tower in Acre and leap off.

Cons are few. The gameplay gets repetitive if you play ALL the sub-missions, and I absolutely hate unrealistic, craptastic gopher missions like the ""get all the flags within 3 minutes"" ones.  Also, a lot of the fights do get a little lengthy, and your button mashing hand will get its workout until you figure out what combos to hit and get your timing down pat, at which point you will take on 20 enemies with a Shaolin-like flow.

I loved the storyline, and no other game I've ever seen crosses the historical lines like this one.  I think its one of the most imaginative and creative stories in a game, ever.

It gets 4 stars from me because now that I'm done, I'm probably never going to play it again.  It was a great experience, there just no payoff to going back to it.  Like a great summer blockbuster movie, once you have gotten the thrills and chills, it never has the same effect, and I would guess this game would be the same way.

Dont let that stop you though - especially now that the price has dropped AGAIN, you've got no excuse but to add this to you collection.  It WILL occupy many, many nights of your life.","Dont worry, the cart of straw will break your 300 foot fall",1217635200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,True,"10 16, 2010",ASQV44WO5LI9W,B002BRZ7JE,bluehobbes_7,"ModNation Racers is a fresh set of wheels for the kart-racing genre. Some have even called it the new king of kart racers. I am hesitant to give the game such lofty praise...perhaps ModNation Racers is the prince to King Mario Kart. For me, nothing will ever quite beat Super Mario Kart or Mario Kart 64.

But ModNation Racers does breathe some life into a genre that had been becoming stale. With even the mighty Mario Kart series stalling out in with same tired old formula and precious few innovative features, ModNation Racers comes to the rescue.

The game borrows from the LittleBigPlanet idea of ""create and share"". In the game, you can build and share tracks, karts, and characters (called ""mods"") online. The community is very creative, and you could spend hours sifting through cool character and kart creations, and racing on community-built tracks.

The single-player is fun, but brutally difficult if you plan on unlocking everything. Some of the challenges feel nearly impossible given the challenging A.I. This is a great racer for all levels of gamer, for hardcore gamers and kart-racers will love the challenge of trying to complete every challenge. The campaign story doesn't really amount to much, but you're probably not playing a kart racer for story, anyway.

The multiplayer is a blast. There is a lot to do, from sharing creations to racing in a variety of modes. This is where, I think, the game really shines, since the multiplayer community is what the whole idea of the game is centered around.

Overall, this is a solid kart racer with a lot of innovations that should be welcomed in a stagnating genre. The biggest flaw, really, is the obscenely long loading screens.

THE GOOD

I didn't get the appeal of the Gamepad at first. But having played it, I admit it's pretty neat. Playing a game on the Gamepad while somebody else is watching TV or while you're in bed is actually pretty fun. Not necessary, but neat.

The graphics are amazing. I'm sure PS4 and XOne will have higher graphics processing power, but I can't imagine I'd never have a need for more.

The eShop is very user friendly, easy to navigate, and downloads pretty fast. Also, Amazon and Netflix offer HD and plays well.

THE BAD

The biggest frustration with the Wii U is that it doesn't allow you to separate video and audio output into separate inputs, so if you want to connect the Wii U to external speakers it's actually quite a bit of trouble. I bought an HDMI expander that separates them and I happened to have spare HDMI and component cables, but the expander cost about $40, increasing the price of the unit.

THE VERDICT

If you have the money to spare, I definitely recommend the Wii U. There still aren't many games on it, but I'm sure more will come out. Unlike the Wii's motion controls, the Wii U doesn't revolutionize gaming and there is a very big risk that games will try to force the Gamepad in gimmicky ways.

It's so easy to get immersed in the gameplay anyway, and it's multiplied greatly if you are playing with friends or family to back you up on the other instruments and vocals.

That was a fleeting moment, as you realize pretty early on what the story is going to be and that many old characters will be making an appearance (not a spoiler if you have seen any of the bombardment commercials on either the TV or online).

This is where my positives end and the agony begins.  As I would hate to write anything negative, I have to put my bias aside and give a real world review.  The story is pretty predictable from the get go.  Not very many surprises there.  If you think its going to happen, it pretty much will follow that line.  The gameplay has always been a huge issue for me through this game series.  I can sum it up in a few words: Jump/Climb/Swing/Shoot.  At least in this game they added a little more, but its not much.

The graphics are great.  The locations are cool.  The controls are decent once you get used to the new layout.  The multiplayer is great and keeps you coming back for more.  The music is decent. The new tools can be fun in small doses.

The Bad

Some of the tracks make you want to throw your controller through the screen.  There are too many places where you can kill yourself.  This is where this game loses some of it's charm.  Instead of feeling invincible like you did in the old ones you often just feel fustration.

You cannot create your own avatar. After ""On-Tour"" I thought that would have stayed in the series but they took it away.  That was a bummer.

Obviously, the cases get more and more complicated as the game progresses, and saving the lives of these patients becomes truly a race against time, as well as the strange ailments that befall upon them.

In essence, Trauma Center requires you to perform surgeries after surgeries. While this may sound a little repetitive, you probably won't even notice it in practice. The game is paced so quickly, you'd barely have any time to think about what to do next, and before you know it, you're on the job again. Sharp instincts, quick reflexes and a lot of patience are what will get you through the game. But if you're into unveiling the mystery behind GUILT and its perpetuator, you wouldn't be shortchanged too. The game did a good job of making a simple story interesting, and despite some insanely difficult to perform surgeries (and many lost lives), you'll get great satisfaction out of every soul you save.

Saving lives is not exactly rocket science in Trauma Center. It basically involves selecting an item from the icons on the sides of the touch screen, and applying them to the wounded areas. For example, you can suture a wound by stroking your stylus in a zigzag fashion over a cut, or remove a foreign object from the bodies by lifting it in the correct direction by holding it and slowly dragging it away with the stylus. Your assistant will also give you instructions on the top screen on what to do, so you ought to have some ideas on how to make things work like a real surgeon, even though you may never emulate the handwriting. However, as the action gets thicker and faster, you may simply find the advice being a bother rather than help.

And then they give you some cases when no one else is around to advise you.

Such is the pressure of Trauma Center, I'd only recommend it to gamers who have a strong heart (no pun intended). If you're not into looking at wounds and lacerations, the game won't shock you by the quite unrealistic graphics (for the bodies and blood and what have you - the nurses, I mean, people, are generally well drawn ). But it does have the potential of making you want to throw your DS towards the wall when you fail to save yet another a life, and that's when the real problem comes in. The game is very difficult to play, and as I mentioned, you'll need a lot of patience to engage it. But at least it tries to help you concentrate on the task by toning down the audios, which may not be a plus point for some, but definitely one for me.

And, if after all that I wrote, you still think you've what it takes to seek the truth behind GUILT, you should immediately turn off that episode of ER, and make an appointment with Trauma Center: Under the Knife.",They'll survive,1129852800,155,,

The game clevery mixed in humor, a some what different type of gameplay, and of course good plain fun.  Before I go into the basics I must clear up something, this is not a racing game.
I'll start with the gameplay.  In Crazy Taxi you must pick-up persons and bring them to different areas.(Like the airport)  This is were the fun factor comes in.  There is 2 courses and a mini game area called crazy box.  The game also has 4 different drives, each with there own car and strenghts.  I must say Crazy Taxi does hold impressive gameplay.
Next is the sound and the graphics.  The graphics are good, they are very smooth, clean, ect.  Yes, there is a small flaw in the graphics, a very unstable framerate.  In very dense areas of the game it feels like time stops, cause' of how slow it gets.  The sound is crisp, lots of different voice samples.  But in the sound comes another flaw, it's the soundtrack.  The soundtrack features; offspring and bad reiligon. This wouldn't be a problem if they had a bigger selection, there's only like four songs of the game.(This is the biggest drawback)

I haven't had an experience where my thumbs slipped off since using these grips.

The only downside from these grips, they don't provide a smooth rotation on the thumb sticks. Because these grips cover the entire thumb sticks, the bottom plastic touches the controller, and thus doesn't provide a smooth rotation.

It is more or less a splice between Zelda and Sim City. The object of the game is to search dungeons the world over to find bits and pieces of your destroyed village. Once you find the pieces, you must rebuild the village. The grid system is similar to Sim City because of the layout, which seemed very familiar to me. I like the whole concept of the game, which makes it a winner in my books.
The graphics are great, despite those who say that the graphics are Sub-Par. The environments are well detailed, and the character animation is very well done. The music is the games biggest weakness. It is mainly background music that doesn't stick in your mind like the music in FFX or Maximo. It also would have been nice to have some voice acting, simply because the PS2 can handel it. Some people might complain that the characters and enemies look ""cartoony"", but it didn't bother me one bit. Remeber ""Ocarina of Time""? Everyone loved that game, and Dark Cloud is quite similar to that.
The battle system is real-time, similar to Zelda and Maximo. People who don't like the random battles with enjoy the battle system here, and controlling the characters is a breeze. The in-game map is also quite nice, and it avoids the hassel of getting lost all the time. I am not the most attentive gamer, and this is a common problem for me.
So who would I recommend Dark Cloud to? Almost everyone I know, since it has RPG elements, but not the lengthy battles and cinematics to put off people who are not RPG fans.

Call of Duty takes place during WW2.  Depending on the level your on, you are either an American,British or Russian soliders in an army.  Unlike many other FPS's where you are basically a ""Rambo"" type, Call of Duty instead does a good job in making you just another person in the army.  There are some few levels where you are on your own, but for the most part its you and the army fighting together.
The graphics on this game is nothing that is earth shattering, but they do however do a very good job into capturing the WW2 feel.  Just playing the first few levels, it is easy to get caught up in your surrounding and actually think you somehow travelled back in time and ended up in the 1940's fighting in WW2.  I espeically loved the Stalengrad level and also the level where you are fighting in the trenches.  I even enjoyed the ""training"" level in which a quartermaster is barking orders to you while you complete tasks in a very realistic looking training course.
The sound in this game also does a very good job in successfully capturing the overall ""war"" feel.  To really appreciate the sound, you must have your speakers turned up a notch.  It was kind of scary running through the fields and having mortars blowing up all around me.  The gun shots, mortars hiting the ground around you and voice acting all contribute to an enjoyable experience.
The overall game play was also done very well.  The controls are almost indentical to most other FPS's.  But this in no way affect the gameplay.  Unlike other FPS however where you can carry at least 9 large guns, here you can only carry what a real human can feasibly carry at one time, this consists of a large gun, a sidearm, and some grenades.  There are always weapons available, but you must drop your weapon before picking up a new one.  You can also pick up your enemies weapons, or your fallen comrades weapons, so there is usually not shortage of ammo or weapons in most cases.
Overall I really enjoyed this game, and plan to play it again.  The level do get a bit tedious and boring near the middle of the game, but the last levels more than make up for it.

I am generally not a fan of stealth shooters, but this game also offers a lot of RPG elements as well as a really good cover system for combat or just sneaking past enemies.  I am doing a stealth-oriented playthrough as opposed to a run-and-gun, which is really testing my enjoyment of the game since stealth is not my srong suit or something I normally enjoy.  Once the controls become familiar, it is a joy to slip between pieces of cover unseen, and the game is fairly generous with autosaves so you can restart just about any room to make sure you complete it to your liking.  Planning on how to tackle a particular area is a lot of fun and the tense minutes while you hack a computer while the enemy's back is turned are pretty exhilarating.

I have also had a lot of fun with the story line so far, hacking computers and getting tidbits of info from emails and pocket secretaries.  The thoroughly imagined world is a major help in the immersiveness of the story line.  The player gets a real sense of being part of the future Detroit where the game takes place.

My only complaint so far is that if you choose to take a stealth-oriented approach to the game, it is difficult to develop much weapon proficiency by the time you get to the first boss.  He is a tank, and will require you to make the most of each bullet and grenade in your inventory.  This can be a frustrating revelation for someone who has spent the first 10 hours of gameplay barely firing a bullet and mostly doing silent takedowns.

Overall though, it is a well-designed game with a great attention to detail.  Graphics could be a little better, but with the amount of content available in this game, there had to be a tradeoff somewhere.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is getting bored with the typical first-person shooter and wants something that will take a little more thought, as well as a deeper plot and immersive experience.",Great game overall,1423180800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

That being said, I thought this was a terrific game. The graphics were nothing short of jaw dropping and the mechanics were very smooth. Some very good points I wanted to highlight:

1) The story:
Nothing fancy or too overblown so anyone can understand it. It only requires a very base knowledge of Resident Evil, and really holds it's own as a standalone tale. Also has a playable file called ""The History of Resident Evil"" which gives you a brief overview of all the previous game storylines in case you were confused as to the story or previous events.
You can get alot more out of it by watching the movie ""Resident Evil: Degeneration,"" as there are alot of references to previous corporations and ""Degeneration"" does well to sum it all up.

2) The Gameplay:
Much of the in-game mechanics are very smooth and the motion capture makes the characters have a very fluid appearance. None of the characters' actions seem joggy or forced, they all have a very ""human"" feel to them.
The quick equip weapons system makes it easy to interchange between firearms and exchange items between your characters.

3) The AI:
Vastly better than alot of the games out there. Not only are the zombies completely able to swarm your characters, alot of them are capable of flanking, piercing your defenses, or waiting for an open opportunity to strike.
Also this applies to your in-game partner, Sheva. The character isn't completely inept and really does help out the main character Chris.

4) The Co-op:
When playing with another person, it truly brings the gaming experience to a whole other level. The amount of teamwork involved in this game make it almost impossible not to have good communication with your partner.
That being said, the AI applied in the co-op is also helpful in that they obey your commands quickly and efficiently.
Another great point is that none of the co-op schemes are ""pre-destined"" in that many of the situations can be flipped to where either Sheva or Chris is in danger and one or the other needs to cover you.

5) The graphics:
As I said are nothing short of amazing. The level of clarity and detail included in the environments is beautiful and distinct. Not only that, but there are a vareity of environments to go through, so you can see the beauty of a dust covered African village, or the darkness of the wet marshlands.

Overall this is a very solid game. While many will cut it down in comparison to Resident Evil 4, from a new perspective, Resident Evil 5 does a great job.

I've heard that the Live version on plain xbox isn't any good but I don't know. People continually say that this game stinks on the Xbox. I don't know what they are talking about, maybe they don't like the change of a good series such as Ghost Recon but the change, although strange, is a good one. Just to know the rating is actually 4 1/2 stars not 4. The game is a mix of Ghost Recon (obviously) Star Wars Rebpuclic Commando, the hand motions and the way you put your squadmate into positions is like the Brothers in Arms series. There is even a mix of Rainbow Six in there. Having the game in different versions for the different consoles is a good idea so if Ubisoft desides to make another Ghost Recon game (they probably will) they know which way to make it. I would say the two best ways to make this great game would be in the Xbox version or 360. The update in first person view is a very good idea, I like first person better but not when there is no gun there. I wuold say that Ubisoft should allow you to swap weapons again, but if they are going to let you to swap weapons I would make sure you can only hold four weapons or so, not as many as you want. And if they let you swap your weapons I would make it take a long time because if you were to swap weapons on a real battlefield (Tom Clancy is war) you would have to find some more ammo on the body at the same time. Even though swaping isn't really necessary since the weapons you get are weopns that fit the current situation, and if you aim wisely you shouldn't run out of ammo that easily. Also the reloading times are a little short of a Ghost Recon game but they are still a good length. Unlike the current games of Rainbow Six, they are getting weirder and weirder with each game and more and more unlike a hard tactical game, with weapons that reload too quick. The graphics are pretty stunning although on the xbox I can say that they rate in second place (with Half-Life 2 in first place) the hot sun of Mexico looks pretty good in this game, with dark nights and blinding days, this game's graphics can pass several other games which rate high in visuals. The sound is great especially with the explosions of grenades, and bombs. Now for the storyline, being a Tom Clancy Game the storyline has to be threatning and it is. I won't reveal much, but I can easily tell you that it takes place in the years of 2013, or 2014, I forgot. And that during the crisis, a new Warfighter System has been created for the U.S. and who better to test it than the worlds best war stoppers: The Ghosts. During this revolution of technology something terrible happens (I will not tell you). So overall Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is a great xbox game and is worth a but, if you hate changes in a series like this than don't complain when there is a new technology of fighting you have to expect some changes, to me they are great changes.

Keep in mind that I love this game and recommend that everyone try it.  It really is a must-have game.

For starters, even though it is meant to be a stealth game, there was not a lot of emphasis on stealth.  You could run up to enemies and kill them and not worry about being seen most of the time.  You do not have to hide the bodies or anything like that, though you can if you want to.  Overall, the AI just seems too easy to evade.  Of course, that helps you to feel bad-ass like a ninja, but if you like a challenge, sometimes, it just gets on your nerves.

The controls for mouse and keyboard are hard to get used to.  You can edit the key binds, but the mouse is used a lot for super moves and finishers.  The Xbox 360 controls are a lot more comfortable and make the game easier to play.  However, I continued playing with the mouse and keyboard, because I did not think to recharge the controller.  Anyway, if you have a controller, the game is a lot better with one.

The skills you unlock cannot be degraded, so if you pick a skill/utility and end up not liking it, you cannot revert to the older items.  There were times when I actually missed the original items or needed them for achievement hunting.  Overall, though, the upgrades really make the game a lot of fun.","Honestly, this game is addictive but there are some flaws.",1368403200,,,

Ram,"Ninja Gaiden Sigma is the third version of the ""new"" Ninja Gaiden that first appeared on the original Xbox (and was later re-released on that system as Ninja Gaiden: Black). For the most part, it's much the same game; the storyline and settings have mostly been untouched, and while the camera has been improved, it still gets stuck or swings wildly at times. The gameplay is as fast and fierce as ever, and in fact the game is more difficult than I remember, as there are more boss fights and ninpo (magic) seems much less powerful than it used to be. Then again, there's more satisfaction in beating harder enemies.

Aside from the graphical upgrades, there are other things that spice up the experience for those who have played the older versions of the game. The biggest addition is in a few levels where you play as Rachel. While it's interesting to kick butt as a sexy, warhammer-wielding vixen, the fun wears off quickly - her levels and enemies are the same as Ryu's, she only has one weapon and a limited moveset, and she attacks very slowly. Those levels feel like padding rather than a new experience.

Other differences include new weapons (dual katanas), a few new enemies and bosses, different/moved/new music at times, and a few changes to previous areas. Some of these are welcome changes...for instance, the water level after the aqueduct is much shorter and features less fetch-questing, and you no longer HAVE to climb the floating pyramids after fighting Doku the first time. There are still annoyances though, like the ghost fish and other enemies who attack in ravenous packs (like the cat-people from the mission mode in Black). The puzzles in the pyramid have been removed and replaced with three tough enemies, and there are other places that have been made more difficult (especially since you can't initially change the difficulty, unless you die several times and continue as a ""Ninja Dog"").

Although the in-game graphics look solid in HD, the original cutscenes have simply been ported over and look noticeably poor (they were great before, but on the PS3 they look blurry and jaggy, like they were re-sized to be larger.).

The K70 resembles the Razer Blackwidow X, an ""open-board"" design, with no back-plate, so the LED's just glow off the back of the frame, which may reduce the brightness but may make the colors appear more vibrant.

The Strafe however, resembles the Blackwidow Ultimate, with a ""closed board"" design, so you have the frame, a red backplate (white if you have the RGB version) and then the switch. So the Strafe has a red backplate to make the colors ""pop"" not as vibrant as the K70, but a whole lot brighter. If you have the RGB version you have a white backplate, so make all the colors pop.

Other than that, the only other major difference is the lack of media keys and volume keys, but luckily we do have a function key we can use to access these settings, just press FN and either F5 or F7-F12. Though if you want dedicated media keys, you can get the K68, which is very similar to the Strafe but has media keys and is dust and spill resistant.

Back to the review, this keyboard has a very simplistic design, which isn't bad at all. There's lots of gaming/mechanical keyboards that look like they came out of a sci-fi movie, which just goes to show companies will do anything to make a buck. This however, just looks like a premium keyboard, no weird corners or shapes, just a keyboard. Design gets an A+.

The Strafe uses Cherry MX switches, and knowing Corsair we couldn't expect less from their mechanical keyboard line up. The Red Led version of the strafe offers: Blue, Brown, Red and Silent switches. Mine has Cherry MX Blues, and for the most part the switches are implemented very well. However, I really do not like the stabilizers, as they are Cherry stabilizers. While they may be easier to work with when taking off the key caps, they don't feel as good as a Costar stabilizer, they just make the larger keys not feel mechanical, its like they bottom out right away. In fact, this is one of the reason why I'm rating this 4 stars. Switches get a B.

This keyboard is actually packed with quite a bit of features. You have:

N-Key rollover, so if you press every single key at the same time they will all register.
Full anti-ghosting, so no extra keystrokes or missed keystrokes.
FPS/MOBA keycap set, so if you want to make your WASD keys or a few other keys more easy to find, you can do that.
Key cap puller, seriously, why don't some of the higher end keyboards include this? *Cough* Razer *Cough*
USB 2.0 pass through, plug in the second USB connector into your PC and you can then use the port on the back, very convenient.
Wrist rest cutouts (Newer version of the Red Led Model)
Red Led Backlighting
Windows Lock key

Wow that's a lot of features. But, its amazing. Has features for enthusiast users and hardcore gamer's. However, here's another reason why I'm giving this 4 stars. In 2015, the Strafe RGB was introduced, and was the first Strafe to come with an included wrist rest. And at some point after that the Red led version was updated and now includes cutouts for the wrist rest. And the wrist rest from my old Strafe RGB works beautifully with it. But Corsair, why include the cutouts but not the wrist rest? You can go on Corsair's website and buy a K66/K68 wrist rest (They use the same wrist rest from the Strafe RGB) and pay an extra $10. But why do we have to do that? Features gets a B.

Build quality? What you expect from Corsair. Top notch. This keyboard isn't made of the aircraft grade aluminum like the K70. This is made of a matte-like plastic, and it feels solid. Keyboard doesn't move around when typing and its not a finger print magnet either. Key kap quality? They aren't double shot key caps, but they are decent. Build quality gets an A.

How about the lighting? Being the Red led version, you can actually create your own lighting effects via the Corsair CUE software, though your still limited to 255 shades of red, aka brightness levels. Its probably best just to keep this on the static red color. Lighting gets an A.

Finally, the software. This keyboard is compatible with the Corsair CUE software. With this software you can do anything from change what the Windows lock button does, to changing the lighting, to re-programming the entire keyboard. The limit is pretty much endless.

So, would I recommend this? YES! Amazing features, switches and build quality. Can't go wrong with this keyboard, especially considering its only $80, and its still a great keyboard, despite those 2 small gripes I have with it.",Best Mechanical Keyboard Under $100?

pros:
-large, lush world, filled with tons of quests
-smooth combat, decent menus/interface
-not terribly easy to turn the game off when you need to go to bed (or is this a con!?)

cons:
-graphics in conversations are a couple years behind when compared to mass effect 3 or skyrim... at least on my pc, which runs everything at max settings (note, however, that the world itself looks good, and i wouldn't call the graphics bad at all, just close up.  when you're fighting or exploring, this is a NON issue, it looks great)
-it seems too easy.  maybe it'll get harder as i get into the higher levels, but playing as an archer/mage hybrid (mostly archer) -- i've never even come *close* to dying, and i'm on the highest difficulty setting.  same thing that happened in fable 3... never died once.  never even close.

I've played the PS2 games, and this version on the PSP has simpler controls than the PS2 versions I played, which is very nice.  The way you pull off moves from character to character are fairly identical, so once you've got one character down the rest are easy to learn.
If you're familiar to the Dragon Ball Z story, then there's nothing new here, and you may get bored with the story telling.  If you're not familiar with Dragon Ball Z, then it does fairly adequate in the storytelling, but you may get lost in spots.
The game play is what I like the most. The fights are fast and flashy, which is why I'm a fan dragon ball Z anyway.  The addition of 2v2 really adds to the excitement. Its fun to be fighting one guy and see your team mate blasting an energy wave at another guy in the distance. And rushing to the aid of your teammate, or visa versa.
The other two PSP DBZ fighting games were ok, but the limited in game transformations were very disappointing. In dragon ball z tenkaichi tag team they allow you to transform into all the forms in-game, and even power down from them, which is a big winner for me on the PSP.

Walking the footprints of giants in the horror game genre isn't easy, especially when one of them was your previous incarnation, the original FEAR. Gladly, they got it right, and in fact, even better than the original in many ways.

First off the level design is much more imaginative than in the original F.E.A.R. There are a wider variety of environments (No more endless office corridors!) and they are all very nicely done.

Second, the shock value is as good or better than the original with new affects, startling moments, and fast paced action akin to Doom 3. Slow moments are mixed in, complete with visions of the dead, 1st person cut scenes that move the story along, and a few nice nods to the earlier game.

One of the things I liked best in the original F.E.A.R when it was released was the way the weapons worked. They just felt 'right' and meshed with the environments to create clouds of concrete dust from bullets hitting the walls and support beams, fires, etc. That's been taken to a whole new level in FEAR:2. The combat feels cinematic with you controlling the action. It's amazing. Sometimes I wanted to just sit back and watch what was going on, but couldn't because I would have gotten hacked to pieces by one of the swarming zombies coming my way...

This is a fairly short game, and replay value is average. Once you've played it for the story and been shocked out of your socks at a few places, the intensity level will be lower. However, the game play and visuals will keep you entertained nonetheless.

One of my biggest complaints with the game is that they did a poor job of tying FEAR:2's story together at the end. It will leave you with as many questions as answers, in the same way Fear: Extraction Point frustrated me.

I am a huge advocate for DRM free games. I've written many of those 1 star reviews that so many of you dislike. I will continue to write them, because I believe draconian DRM schemes like SECUrom are terrible for the consumer, and unnecessary as well. However, in the case of FEAR:2 and STEAM, I actually am coming down on the side of STEAM (to an extent):

1. Steam is DRM, but it isn't malicious like Securom and does not enforce limited installations on your computer. It does not take root level control of you computer, and does not attempt to disable other software, nor does it potentially screw up hardware profiles for CD/DVD drives. It is in short, about as benign as I can imagine DRM being, and while it does have its problems (see below) it is a compromise that I can in good conscience make.

2. I already have a STEAM account and have had one since HL1 days, and have a completely satisfactory experience with it, including installing multiple games on a series of different computers over time.

3. STEAM does not attempt to control my computer. It does a simple check with the server and then releases me to play my games. In fact, contrary to common belief, you can unplug your computer's internet and play Steam games all you like once they are activated.

However, STEAM has some real negatives as well:

1. Potentially violates the ""Doctrine Of First Sale"" which guarantees my right to re-sell something that I've purchased. STEAM allows a 1 time transfer of the game to another account, but once it is moved, that's the end. No more transfers. I understand why STEAM does this: to prevent massive rings of gamers swapping games back and forth using their servers to achieve it, bogging up their download severs, etc... While I agree that is a problem for them, I think that limiting transfers violates my rights, and destroys the second hand game market.

2. Requires 'One more program' to be run on my computer. I'm pretty selective about what I install on my PC, and I hate being forced to have yet another program running just to access some of my games.

3. What happens if Steam goes out of business? Will I still have access to my games? How? None of that is spelled out in any documentation from STEAM or VALVE.

So basically I've come into this one with my eyes wide open. It's not that I love STEAM and think it is totally without faults. I just think that its faults are not enough to limit me playing a game as good as FEAR:2. STEAM itself has proved itself reliable in the last 7 years, and so I'm willing to use it to play a game I really, really want to play. The key distinction is that Securom DAMAGES my computer and TAKES AWAY MY ADMINISTRATIVE RIGHT, as well as ENFORCES LIMITED INSTALLATIONS. STEAM does none of those things.

Overall this is a great game. If you can't live with STEAM, I understand, and I honestly probably wouldn't get involved with it either if I didn't already own a bunch of games on it from years past, before I learned about DRM schemes and began to care about such things.

4.0,True,"03 22, 2012",AV62333WQDAXR,B0061YG0O4,Ajay Neela,"Ever since operation RC was announced many people were unsure of what kind game it is. The producers of the game state the concept idea was ""KILL LEON"" and they built the game from there. As more and more detail were revealed many fans knew that this was a spin off title of the RE franchise, kind of like the gun survivor series. The enticing part of the game is in the title, the players would be playing in raccoon city and witnessing the chaos that befall the city in time period of RE2 and RE3. The players can alter event from the original games so in the end its a ""what if"" scenario. Neat idea huh? That's pretty much the games selling point.

You play as the bad guys essentially and your whole mission is to wipe any evidence leading back to your employer Umbrella. This is a cool and refreshing idea. Umbrella corp is the main antoganist throughout the early RE games and finally playing as them or at least a branch of them is still pretty cool. But at the same time its a dissapointment, the characters you play as are merely fan fiction they all look cool and are adapt at disposing zombies but lack anything to differentiate them from another except gender. They are faceless characters with cool voices. I wasn't expecting high caliber character development but at the same time they could of given more back story for some of them, in the end it feels rushed and most people want to play as the famous RE bad guys like HUNK for example.

The singleplayer is pretty bland and the worthwhile thing is playing through to see how you'll interact with the RE event from the original games or you want to shoot zombies with a friends. If your buying it for the latter I'd say skip this game there are a ton of games that offer more co op then this game offers. If your getting it strictly for the story your wasting you money as the single player in general is a missed oppurtunity. They could of made is it a lot more engaging in terms of the actual RE timeline. And the worst part is THERE IS NO COUCH CO-OP! this is a deal breaker if you don't play online its a waste of $60.

Multiplayer, now if your buying the game to play online your in for a treat. I'm currently enjoying the multiplayer a lot, and I rarely get hooked to online shooters. I play FPS casually if ever but this game I really like playing. Its different as in your not always worrying about other players but also B.O.Ws and of course the ever present zombies that litter every map. Surprisingly there is depth to the multiplayer. You gain exp for even killing zombies and other monsters this is small but helpful. The xp you get completing missions in singleplayer crosses over to the multiplayer and vice versa this is helpful for everyone and its indeed helpful if your going to be playing online heavily.

The depth in combat is interesting you have the standard shooting mechanic but sadly no option to change the controls. A cover system is there but its not good and can be a hassle. Its not a press button and viola cover, its more like a sticky cover where you press near a wall or whatever and you'll pop into cover. Its sound easy but sometime you won't have time to adjust when you'll be getting shot at.
Some other cool things about the online combat is the different classes they are all unique for the most part. Each has they're own abilities you can use effectively, you can later upgrade these to make them even more usefull. The medic for example has the ability to use a pheromones such as zombies or BOWs. Its satisfying to tag a enemy player and watch a Hunter go after them.

The modes are varied except for the standard team deathmatch which you've probably played in other games, its no different here except the zombies and bows running about.

The modes that you'll want to play are Heroes which lets you play as RE characters in two teams killing each others captains to win.
Survival is where a helicopter will come in about 4-5 min and if your not on it you'll be left behind, and there is only 4 spots in the copter. Everytime you die it takes longer to respawn.
Biohazard is capture the flag with vials instead of flags unoriginal but still fun.
The multiplayer will keep you busy, there isn't anything wrong with it that i can think of except for some glitches that can happen due to lag but most matches I've been in have been lag free and smooth.

OTHER THOUGHTS

I really didn't expect much from this game. I wanted to try out a multiplayer game since I have xbox live gold for about two more months. And I also wanted to see the scenarios in the singleplayer game. But the surprisingly the multiplayer has got me hooked and for that i'd say its $65 dollars well spent. And I bought the SE for less thanks to pre ordering it early. Thank you amazon

If your getting this for the single player please don't your paying for less content. This is a online/co op game first and single player second. If your looking for a online game with a RE setting then I'd say this game is definitely worth it. But its no way a representation of what resident evil should be online. Still eagerly awaiting another resident evil outbreak. Play it for what it is a spin off title like the gun survivor games.",Far from terrible but good enough if you like online play,1332374400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,True,"02 22, 2012",A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B000809NXW,Christopher Barrett,"Update:

Did a little research and here is the gist:  This is actually a remake of Popolocrois I and II.  What the developers decided on, was tweaking the original game into two 'books' in this game, then adding Popolocrois II as the 3rd 'book'.  You can check out some Youtube video for the original, Japanese games.

But to sum it up: Popolocrois on PS1 starts out differently, with Gami Gami Devil attacking the castle.  Then you join up with Biggs and Wedge... I mean Don and Gon and go after the Wisdom crown.  In this version, you start by looking for a way into Byronia to find the Book of Darkness and restore Pietro's mother's soul.  This story arc comes later in the PS1 version.  The Wisdom Crown and Don and Gon are worked into Book 2 of the PSP version.  Book 2 features a few of the events that were in the PS1 version that weren't in Book 1 of the PSP, but with a lot of new content.

So there are still some things missing from the original Japanese versions, but the designers made a good adjustment of the story and other key elements.  So this is actually two games in one, albeit each one shortened slightly and with some new content.  The graphics are substantially better in the PSP version, though the sprites had more expression in the PS1 versions.  This is the only translated version legally for sale in the US, so if you want to play a classic PS1 game(s) with what was a unique battle system at the time and is still fun, this is a winner.  Just don't expect it to be exactly similar to the PS1 versions.

--------------------------

I can really sum this game up quickly: looks, sounds, plays a lot like Breath of Fire 3 just with a grid based battle system and a RTB gauge (like FF4, Chrono Trigger, etc...)

But to get to the real meat of the review.  PoPoLoCrois is not the prettiest game on the PSP, but it's colorful, well rendered settings endear me more to this game than some of the more 'complex' backgrounds of other games.  It really looks a lot like Breath of Fire 3 with the style and color.  The sprites are not very good, but the animations of the sprites is fluid and they are cute.  I really enjoy watching them when staying at an inn; they pull the sheets back, climb into bed, then you see the sheet lifting as they snooze.

The plot isn't terribly complex or original, but it is full of fun little quips.  I really enjoyed the GamiGami Devil's play where he beat the 'evil and tyrannical Prince Pietro'.  The translation seems pretty nice.  At times though it's tough to really find what to do next, and if you wander into a nearby zone you risk being owned by rather viscous baddies.  Luckily I was able to run when this happened.  But on the map there is an indicator of where you should head next.  Most of the time.

You move about large, expansive fields with random encounters from unseen enemies.  This is all very old school RPG.  The battles are actually quite fun, and that is what makes the difference in my opinion.  Enemies are pretty easy to beat most of the time, owing to lower hit points; but they often have a few tricks up their sleeves.  For example: these ghost enemies in one of the caves seems helpless, but they can cast a shock spell that hits your whole party for 15-25 damage.  You end up running into two and letting them get the edge, then you might be in for a world of hurt.  Still, it never really seems like the game 'cheats', the battles are easy if you stay on your toes.  For those not well versed in traditional RPG combat it might prove more challenging.  And the semi-real time turn based system works well.  Each character has a gauge that fills, when fill they get an attack.  The action pauses while you determine the course of action.  You may move, attack, attack and move, use a special skill, or charge for a focused attack on the next turn.  If you have characters that get in a certain formation with certain conditions, you can unleash a combo attack.

Many of the baddies leave spoils, so you do find a good amount of free loot.  This is nice because gold does not go far in shops.  There is also a lot of loot to be found in the field.  Often chests are in plain sight, but sometimes they are slightly obscured or very well hidden in a few areas.

A few cons:  The music is average to good.  There are some nice tunes, and battle music is different in various areas, so it keeps it fresh.  It has a lot of music that reminds be a bit of Earthbound for the Famicon/SNES.  It fits the mood most of the time though.  Now onto a sore point with me and that is sound effects.  There are few sound effects outside battle.  So when you open doors... no sound.  When you walk... no sound (though that's okay in my opinion).  But there are some moments where you almost start thinking that the sound effect volume was turned off...

The load times were not bad, and on a PSP 3000, once you enter a zone, there was a slight load time that did not repeat as you exited or re-entered the area.  Good job RAM.  There is a slight 2-5 second load before battles, but a little swirling load icon pops up so you know it's a battle.  It doesn't just freeze up for a few seconds like some PSP titles.  There are also some issues with slowdown, but this is mainly in towns where there are a lot of other moving objects on screen.

So in my opinion, the fun factor well overrides any other deficiencies in this title.  I would recommend this for anyone who would enjoy a classic, nostalgic RPG with a fun battle system.

Pros:
+ Fun battle system
+ Very pretty and colorful graphics
+ Engaging story, fun characters, humor
+ Good loot makes for fun exploration
+ Skill leveling system not exciting but works well
+ Lack of fast travel forces a lot of walking
+ Easily accessible bestiary in game that fills as you beat baddies
+ Pretty maps accessed with R trigger

Cons:
- Some slowdown in certain areas
- Can be easy at times
- Pressing X makes you walk, is also used to 'check' for things
- No option to turn off auto run (hold X to walk)
- No map indicator for your location

You stumble upon a gas station/motel/lodge and notice empty cars still running, tables knocked over, and eventually a very scared man locked in his office. You must then proceed to do the typical adventure game thing ... read notes and collect items to put the mystery together. The game is meant to be spooky, and it does cast an eerie atmosphere over the player - but don't expect to be truly terrified by any stretch.

In the vein of the Dark Fall series, this one succeeds in presenting puzzles and inventory quests that blend perfectly with the environment and the location of the story. There aren't any goofy ""tape the cell phone to the cat and feed it salt-laced pizza to make it go into the next room for water and thusly overhear the conversation"" type malarky. I was able to complete very nearly the entire game without consulting a walkthrough. Only near the end did I need to make a quick consultation to find one hotspot I had missed.

The other thing the game succeeds in is mood. No, it isn't Silent Hill level scary, or Resident Evil level jumpy ... but it does still cast an eerie mood. I love the integration of the nearby radio station that you can access in several areas - gives the opening chapters of the game a feeling reminiscent of John Carpenter's classic THE FOG.

My only reservations were the sheer number of dead ends. This is a slide-show type game where you click from one still pre-rendered scene to the next ... and there are A LOT of these screens - and A LOT of them lead you nowhere - you will zoom in and pick up items without collecting them, scratching your head wondering what the significance is, only to find out in the end that many of these objects are just there to be picked up and looked at. I suppose this was an effort to throw a little extra challenge into what was otherwise a short and simple game.

The only other gripe is that the menu bars are set to pop-up whenever you scroll near the top or bottom of the screen, which means any time you are exploring a scene and get too close to either extreme, the menus pop up. It's a small gripe, but one that I really started to notice near the end as I was trying to quickly wrap things up.

Don't try to jump to the street off of a building though because the mission will be failed. The game was well thought up. The Joker is killed early in the game.

B&W1 had alot of problems. There were bugs, and there were problems. I loved the game, but people had logical complaints. Most of that stuff has been fixed, but it might not fit your preference.

When I get into the game, I love it. You now build a more intricate town, which is great. You can also create armies which is fun. Having huge battles can be awesome if you have multiple platoons. You can control as many platoons as you have men. Your village has a specific number of men, women, children, and elderly. You may lose alot of your men to war, but your town won't be hindered that much. The best battles are those where you have archers, catapults, and soldiers all killing each other. The game kinda screws you though because it practically forces you to use catapults. I wanted a good creature, and if you send him into battle to destroy enemy walls it will make him evil.

The creature is much easier to use. He now talks to you through chat. You can easily teach him to do stuff now. If you want him to poop in fields, he will. If you want him to gather grain, he will. This kinda sucks because it is much more simplistic. I started having him work out and it said he was evil for some reason. Now, I'm having a really hard time getting him to be good because he won't do alot of things I tell him. Also, he has so many evil tendencies, like killing innocent animals, that it is hard to compensate for everything and make him good. Still, you can have a lot of fun with your creature. Even though, to my knowledge, they can't learn miracles, your creature will occasionaly cast some that he must already know. Whenever he builds a home, he uses miracle wood. In this game, there aren't that many good powers. You will be using water and heal alot if you want to use miracles, but I haven't recieved miracle grain or miracle wood for some reason.

Building towns can be fun. There are a lot of interesting buildings that you must unlock. They expand your influence and make people want to come to your town. You can avoid war altogether and entice people to live in your city, but where is the fun in that? Also, your store house can only hold so much grain, wood, and ore. You will either have too much or not enough. I hate how there is a limit, because I wasted alot of wood and grain my first few hours.

People now don't complain as much. In the first B&W, you could never satisfy everyone. Now, people have logical complaints and address how concerned they are.

The graphics and sounds are top notch. Waving your hand over flowers will move them. There are interesting bump maps which make some textures seem curvacious. There are also really nice character models now for every town.

All in all, I like this game alot. If you do hate it, I don't know what to tell you. If you hated the first game or hate RTS games in general, do not get this. If you worry about replay value, the game is fairly long considering it takes a while to play each island.

Facts:
1. You can use this to upgrade your base game.  Just go to steam and redeem the steam code which is included inside the box.  You don't even need to use the CD.
2. It requires Steam obviously.
3. You need to be online on Steam to activate this game which is a 1 time thing, after that, you can put Steam in offline mode by clicking a button.  Next time you run steam will always be in offline mode unless you decide to go back online.
4. It can be played offline after initial installation/activation by using Steam offline mode.  Guaranteed no internet required.  (Been doing this for years)
5. You might want to occasionally go online to get updates on the game as devs fix bugs and stuff.
6. You can legally ""mod"" this game.  Modding is changing certain aspects of the game.  Google it.  Its part of what makes this game great.

Pros:
1. Lots of things to do even without the DLCs.
2. Original game offers tons of quests, a Main quest, 4 other majot quest line from different factions and tons of small side quests per major location.
3. DLCs change certain aspects of the game which made it look new to me.  More weapons, armor, enemies and brand new quests.  1 major quest for each DLC and tons of additional side quests.
4. Ease of adding mods makes this game infinitely great.  Want to make you character fart instead of shout?  There is a mod for that :)
5. Customization of characters gives you so many possibilities.  Want to be a destruction mage?  or a sneaky assassin? or an archer, or a brute force player who uses massive two handed weapons... or... or...  or all of the above?  all possible.
6. Price, the game is a few years old but for 20$ with all DLCs, its money well spent for countless hours of fun.  And if you add mods, it extends the game even further

Cons:
1. Some of dialog do not change even after significant events have happened.  Spoiler alert:  For example in the Companions, after finishing the quest line, and being declared as the ""harbinger"", the people still talk to you as a noob and still treat u as a noob and give you noob repeating quests.  Minor but kills story immersion.
2. Game balance.  At high levels, you can virtually kill anything in one shot even at the hardest setting because you can exploit certain skills to be that powerful, for example you can creation potions which gives you 20K% damage, or u can forge weapons that do this much damage.  But at low levels where u pretty much rely on weapons and armor u pick up, u die pretty much every step (at the highest difficulty) due to the huge power gap from u and similar level enemies.
3. Lots of bugs.  As can be expected from a huge game, but, some bugs from day of release are still here years after so they are likely to stay.  Luckily there are a lot of info on the web to overcome this especially for the PC version.  If you think some of the quest progression does not make sense, its likely you have hit a bug.

But despite this, overall great game. By itself, and even better game if u add some mods.  Fair warning, u will lose countless hours in this game for sure.","Easy math, 3 stand alone DLCs cost u 45$",1460505600,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

The environments are much more in-dephth this time around, the AI is actually slightly challenging, now the squad sensibly follows you around, and on-the-spot tactics are the way to play rather than the pre-set waypoints from the earlier PC versions.  Being able to call your tactics as you know you need them is extremely helpful.  The big flaw with  the waypoints was that you couldn't change them as they were occurring, and the methods of ordering around the squad was never very easy.
One feature that I really liked about this game was....DIFFERENT WEAPONS YAAAAY!!!  There is an all new lineup of guns to choose from.  You can finally use the AK47, grenade launchers, and a new lineup of machine pistols.  In R6 Rogue Spear: Black Thorn for the PC, these weapons were only available for multiplayer.....big mistake.  The new, better focus on action mixed with graphical, envirnomental, and AI interaction, both allies and enemies, has vastly improved the game on the Playstation platform.  I think that this is finally a Playstation R6 game that actually beats R6 Covert Ops.  I found that renting the game wasn't enough time to enjoy it, so this game might actually be a very good purchase...I'll find out later this week.",More focused on action....and there are more weapons!!!!!!!,1088208000,,,

4.0,False,"01 14, 2014",A1POGSPD4HN8Y1,B004EW948E,Cap&#039;n Stoob,"This game is pretty good.  Although it didn't make the superstar ranking on IGN or the other review sites, it has a surprisingly big fan base and I hope Sega puts out a good sequel.

The plot of the game is kind of like the movie AI, where robots get smart enough to supplant Humanity.  The best part of the game is the variety of robots and the smooth animations and tactical decisions they make in firefights.  There is a special set of algorithms that the robots use to try to flank you, use cover, alert others and focus fire.  Even when you've blown off their legs, they will reboot and crawl towards you to clutch your legs and impede you!  Normal bots are pretty dopey, but several different bots have super specializations and you will curse the shinobi and sniper bots towards the end of the game. This game is NOT an unrealistic tactical game; if you charge in with guns blazing, you WILL DIE.  You need to use cover and keep your squad focused.  You need to manage ammo early on and the need for upgrades versus immediate supplies versus nanomachine augments for your squad.  There's a LOT to this little game and you wouldn't know it from reading some of the cursory reviews from the ""big name"" sites that obviously didn't get into the game's depth.

The game IS a shooter on rails, but it's well done.  I lived in Japan for years and the old Tokyo looks like shitamachi areas and the Upper City really has that Japanese technofuturistic feel. There is plenty of Japanese dialogue (which is well done, even if the translations are off a bit) and I really like how the signs and real brand names are incorporated into the backgrounds to really give life to the city.

The controls are OK and take a little getting used to.  You will get knocked about, knocked down and staggered when taking damage and that can work against you when you take a shot from a boss, fall down and then he stomps you flat.  You'll also have to complete some of the quicktime events more than once....as they are easy to screw up.  Your squadmates can be a little obtuse, too, jumping in front of your fire and then griping about it.

The trust system is pretty cool but it doesn't affect your squad very much.  What it DOES do, however, is affect the ending you see and you will want to keep high trust through the entire game.  Just answer logically when they ask a question, don't shoot them and go for melee kills and headshots to bump that trust up.

The boss fights can be a little cheap.  Each major boss has several attacks that will stagger you mid run and the final boss will aggravate you for a half hour with weapons that take you out in one hit.  Thankfully, your squadmates can revive you and you can use first aid kits to both revive yourself AND your squadmates...which you want to do before they die!  They will also help each other.  The shops sell spare first aid kits, nanomachine upgrades, ammo, grenades, bosonic charge for your rifle and a limited selection of weapons.

It's not a long game.  I'd estimate 10 to 15 hours total to get through it.  But it's a good game with a pretty cool story.  If you can pick it up for less than $20, definitely do so.

*Note #1: To save space, I've  removed some of the content in my review and placed it in the CUSTOMER DISCUSSION section, at the bottom of the first page of this listing. Click on the posts, if you want some more information about Nascar 08.

*Note #2: I own Nascar 2002 through 2006, and although I haven't played Nascar 07, I have read all the 07 reviews on each website. Also, I have NOT played Nascar 08 online.

If you have an older Nascar game and just want to know if you should rent, buy, or skip, Nascar 08, then you can just scroll down near the end of this review, and read the Checkered Flag section, which lists five questions you should answer, followed by the Victory Lane section (summary) part.

Unless you have no trouble winning in Nascar 2002-2006 (without assists and using the default car setups), you should be able to find plenty of tracks in 08, that will give you some thrilling race action. Some, like Talladega, are often too easy, but nothing's perfect, anyway.

If you're new to these Nascar games, you should know that the only way to change the assists, or to use manual transmission, is to start a race. Then, before it begins, just pause the game, and choose 'Settings', then 'Driving Controls'. Now go ahead and make any changes.  You can change 'Steering Sensitivity', here as well, or from the main menu (I used a regular controller and didn't need to adjust it). Exit out, by pressing the triangle button. The auto-save will eventually save everything, so don't worry. Now you're ready to play.

Gentlemen and ladies, start your engine(s)!

GREEN FLAG (Some GOOD things in the game):
Yes, Nascar 08 looks very similar to 07 (has motion blur effect,etc.), and they took away lots of stuff (like the various Dodge Challenge scenarios), but this game has added a lot, as well.

This is the first time I didn't have to use any driving Assists (except when I used the Limited assist, for starts and restarts ONLY with the Nextel Cup cars) to  keep up with the Cpu cars, and also still have fun racing against them. It's simply one of the easiest to drive, racing games I've ever played. Perhaps TOO easy, for any of you that did well driving without any assists, in the older Nascar games.

Although the Mid-Race saves work very well, and I LOVE them, they are NOT perfect saves. They are NOT good at accurately saving some stats, like # of laps lead (which might cost you up to 10 lost points, in season mode, for example), best laps, and when drivers are knocked out of race, they are back in (when you reload the mid-race save), just a few laps down etc. No big deal, but if you want all your race stats saved accurately, don't use the mid-race saves.

Even worse, the Mid-Race saves are time-coded, so whenever you LOAD one of them, you're actually going back in time, to that exact moment you saved--thus losing anything that you might have gained or earned after it. So, you better finish your saved race, BEFORE you try a different race, or mode. Otherwise, once you load an older mid-race save, you'll lose any progress (in Season, Career, Chase mode, etc.), medallions, and chase plates, that you earned after that older mid-race save was made. You could, however, just use a separate, 2nd memory card, if you want to be able to jump back and forth between different mid-race saves (without playing the other modes, like Career, Season, Chase, etc., with this 2nd memory card).

In addition, the 2 player split-screen mode (not available in PS3 version), lets you race against 17 cpu cars (so, there are a total of 19 cars on track), but if you don't use the Legend difficulty, they let player #1 catch up too easily. There's no rearview mirror for this mode, but you can look back with the right stick.

Tired of always waiting for your spotter to tell you if you're in the clear? Well, now you can use the Right joystick to look to your left or right or even behind you to see for yourself. It can be a little disorienting at first, but it's so handy!

Another great thing in 08, is the ticker at the top that shows the race positions of the drivers (lap times, etc.). If you have trouble reading it while racing, you can shut it off or just pause the game, and it will still keep scrolling. You can even move it left or right (while in pause only) with the d-pad or left stick.

The new 08 feature, that lets you instantly rewind up to 8 seconds (good driving earns the time) within a current race (just press select button, when symbol appears), so that you can avoid a crash etc., sounds good in theory, but in practice, it usually doesn't help much. Simply, you often are only given 3 or 4 seconds instant rewind time, which usually isn't enough time to avoid anything. However, it has helped me out on occasion (if I had 6-8 seconds available).

There are 192 Medallions (finish first in a race, etc.) and 53 chase plates (no paint schemes) to unlock.

BLACK FLAG (Some BAD things in the game):
 The career mode (Earn Your Stripes) has been changed (can't own teams), and even though it's somewhat similar, many people (myself included), don't like it that much (rather dull). You still can only race 25% races in the career mode, but at least it saves some career stats for you.

 Unfortunately, the Modified series is basically useless, since I can win on Legend difficulty (the hardest), even starting last (22nd). To give myself a challenge, I have to use full downforce, lowest tire pressure (15 lbs), even increase my nose weight to +10 %, left weight to +5%, and make the race the shortest (like 6 laps). Even then, I still finish 5th, but the car runs like a tugboat, so it wasn't really fun. Some tracks like Tiburon make it only slightly tougher. As well, the Trucks are also fairly easy to win with on many tracks, so I use Legend difficulty, if necessary.

What's worse, is that the Cpu cars on the Talladega track accelerate so slowly on the starts and restarts, that you can gain from 5-42 positions (on Legend), just by driving by yourself on the left side of the track. It works almost all the time with the COT or Trucks. Generally, it's much tougher with the Busch or regular Nextel Cup cars, but I'm sure eventually, I'll be able to crush those cpu cars as well.

In addition, if you don't use any assists, it's very difficult to avoid spinning your tires (for Nextel Cup cars ONLY-yes, for COT car, as well) on starts and restarts, thus falling behind the other cars. You can try practising in the 'Race Now' mode, by choosing to Restart the race, over and over again, but I gave up and just decided to use the Limited (or full) assist. Usually, right after the starts, I'll pause the game and remove the assist, until I need it again, for any restart that might occur.

There's Total Team Control once again (press in right joystick to activate it), but NO more car swapping during races is allowed. Strange, because it was a nice extra twist if your car was wrecked or you wanted to try to get all your teammates to finish well.

It's sad that they removed the Dodge Challenges (recreated race scenarios, from real Nascar races, that you could race in).

Once again, you don't get disqualified if you keep intentionally spinning or wrecking the Cpu cars. As well, if you cause a caution, you get to stay where you are, instead of being put farther back in the field, or getting a drive-through (pit lane) penalty. These factors often help make it super easy to do well, and are further proof that this is more of an arcade racer, than a simulation.

CHECKERED FLAG (Helpful Questions):
Can't decide if you should rent, buy, or skip Nascar 08 for the PS2? Then just answer these five questions:

1) Do you care about mid-race saves? If yes, then this is a must buy! (Note: The Mid-Race saves, don't save some race stats accurately, like # of laps lead, etc., and they are time-coded, so if you load one of them, you'll lose any progress or unlockables that you earned after that mid-race save was made).

2) Are you interested in being able to look around your car (even behind), while you're racing (use right joystick)? If you are, then it's at least worth a rental.

3) Do you think a very good career mode is necessary for you to buy this game? If the answer to this is yes, well then, you're probably going to be disappointed, since you can't own cars, etc. There are part upgrades you can buy, but the whole thing seems dull overall. Not awful, but then again, you may think so. Renting first, may be your best option then.

4) Were the Dodge Challenges (recreated race scenarios, from real Nascar races, that you could race in), one of the main reasons, you bought any of the previous EA Nascar games? If the answer is yes, then perhaps you should just rent, since they have been removed from Nascar 08. Unless you think re-racing some of your mid-race saved races, offers good enough extra value (like I do).

5) If you eventually find the single player game too easy, and finish in the top 5, in most races, will you then be willing to just use the default car setups, or even add downforce and make other adjustments to make it harder?

(Note: If it's still too easy, then try using worst rated driver Reed Sorenson (Grade D). It doesn't really make that much of a difference though. However, if you start the race in last position (43rd), that will most often make it tougher. Remember, the longer the race, the easier it is to catch up, on any of the three difficulty levels and with any driver. You can also disable the 'Driver Attributes', so that Reed Sorenson, etc., is just as good as anyone else).

Question #5 is very important because so many people complain about the easy factor. I don't always find it too easy using the default settings on the veteran difficulty for Nextel Cup or Busch, but Modifieds are too easy (even on Legend), and the Trucks can be as well, on some tracks. Thus, I have to use Legend diffic. quite often for the Trucks.

It's also easier to drive all these cars/trucks without any assists on, in this game (than in the earlier EA games...{I skipped 07}), because if you hit the walls in 08, you more easily bounce off them, rather than stick to them and fall way behind, like in the 2002-2006 Nascar games.

So, if you're not willing to do any work trying to make yourself slower, for some of the very easy races, that's still okay, because there are so many races that are great or very good. Therefore, it's still worth a purchase or at least a rental.

VICTORY LANE (Summary):
This is a fun and very addicting game, but if you're too good, you may be unimpressed. It plays more like an arcade racer, even though there are more things to adjust than ever before-it's just not often required, since the default car settings are good enough. Also, the cars handle so well (even without any driving assists turned on--except in rare instances, like during the Nextel Cup cars, starts and restarts), with only some slight braking, or slowing down in turns needed (depending on the track, of course). Cpu cars will often soar into the air doing repeated barrel rolls, and then somehow safely land on all four wheels, or just magically flip themselves upright, usually without missing more than a lap, if any. Your car, on the otherhand, is often wrecked and eliminated from the race, if you do the same.

Unfortunately, there aren't any Dodge challenges this time around, and the teammate car swapping ability during a race, is gone, even though all the other Total Team Control choices are available (except for voice commands). As well, both the Milwaukee and IRP race tracks have also been removed. However, the 23 real tracks (all 22 Nextel Cup tracks + Nazareth), plus 9 fantasy tracks, and four infield tracks (Daytona, Texas, Talladega, Phoenix) are more than enough to keep you busy (that's a total of 36 tracks-not counting night versions). Hopefully, one day, EA will let us create are own tracks. Nascar 09, perhaps?

I sometimes get dizzy with 3D worlds where the mouse movements can get you spinning in multiple directions, but didn't have any trouble with this game.

The puzzles involved challenges such as aligning tumblers in a lock to open a chest; gathering ingredients/objects to build another item; rearranging tiles to form an image; placing objects into the correct location; answering trivia questions; and countering black magic spells during a sorceress duel.  The final puzzle was by far the most challenging: sort of a chess/checkers board layout with an evil snake. I finally had to get help for that one on the internet .. the hints given in the game were good but my strategy would never have allowed me to win.

Overall, I enjoyed the game.  Parents should know that the casting of spells is involved, and that various Egyptian mythological gods are worshipped by the main character and supporting characters throughout the game.

Hill,"We played Pirates! back on the old Commodore 64 and it was one of our favorite games of all time, so we were thrilled when we saw that there was a release for the PC. This plays a lot like the original game and is still an exceptionally fun game.

The basic goal of the game is to rise as high as possible by building a reputation, wealth, and completing missions for various leaders (governors, priests, etc).

Your reputation will be important as you attempt to impress the various governor's daughters (ultimately seeking the hand of one in marriage). Dancing with the daughters is very important and you will need to do it a lot, but it is also the one aspect of the game that I don't like as it does get somewhat repetitive.

There are several basic ways to get wealth, but preying on ships of whatever country is at war with yours is one of the fastest. I really enjoy the ship to ship and captain to captain combat that is involved in capturing other ships, but watch out for the pirate hunters that seek you out when you become more famous. You can also gather pieces of treasure maps that will lead to hordes of gold, but that generally takes more time.

Like all pirate captains you have to make some tough choices and worry about keeping your crew happy (or you might find yourself on the wrong end of a mutiny).

This is an addictive game that can be played over and over but one complaint from my daughter is that you can only be a male in the game.

4.0,False,"01 16, 2014",A22S7D0LP8GRDH,B00D349WB8,Jacob and Kiki Hantla,"I love the sound that these headphones put out.  Among all of my headphones (I am a nerd and a reviewer and have probably a dozen and a half different nice headphones) these are my favorite for both sound and feel. The sound is full, especially rich on the bass end, but with the ability to reproduce the high tones well too; coming from the very good 50 mm drivers. The cups and the headband are soft and fit nicely without squeezing. I can use these for 8-10 hours on end without getting a headache, which is relatively unique among this type of headphone. The bluetooth is especially nice for long mobile wearing sessions, totally untethering you from the device. And they headphones stay in place well, even while exercising (on the elliptical; they do fall off while jogging aggressively). The range on the bluetooth is quite good, allowing me and extra 10-15 ft beyond some of my bluetooth earbuds. And the battery will easily last 8-10 hours on a charge, even with noise cancelling and active mixing on. A nice feature is the ability to use the phones with an included 3.5 mm cable or connected to a computer via USB. Finally, using the iOS app or the computer app, sound profiles/adjustments can be made on the device, performed by the onboard processor. It is a nice feature that works well, to amplify the bass or cut it out as desired.

In summary of the pro's
1. Excellent sound
2. Very comfortable.
3. Stable fit without a tight squeeze on head
4. Better range than any of my other bluetooth headsets
5. Long battery life (>8 hours even with noise cancelling and audio adjustments active).
6. Option for 3.5 mm or USB input.
6. Nice, effective onboard audio adjustment/mixing.

I would love to give these headphones a 5 star review. They deserve it for the above features, especially at the very reasonable three hundred dollar price point, well priced for the features. However, the problem is that there are some bugs that make me take a star off and give the buyer a few words of warning. Nevertheless, I still recommend the headphones. In summary, here are my problems that make me consider these headphones too buggy for a five-star rating. I hope these get fixed with a firmware upgrade:
1. Can only connect to two devices.
2. When connecting to a computer via the USB port, it regularly will get disconnected even while playing (sometimes audio driver crashes requiring restart on Windows 8). Sometimes, the computer will not detect the headphones at all. This occurs on two different computers.
3. You cannot hotswitch between playing audio through the 3.5 mm cord and then disconnect and go back to usb or bluetooth; you have to shut the headphones off and then back on in order to change modes reliably.
4. When playing audio through my iPhone, the audio can completely stop at times. The iPhone looks like it is continuing to play, however, no audio comes out of the phones. This happens most regularly when changing apps within the iPhone. The only way to get the audio to restart is to turn bluetooth off and then back on on the iPhone. This is the only bluetooth device that I regularly have this problem with, indicating that the problem is with the headphones. Customer service did not help on this issue.
5. Somewhat confusing at first to get connected. The manual is helpful and easy to understand.

These problems are relatively minor compared to the upsides, especially if you only plan on using the headphones for bluetooth connectivity. I do not recommend the phones based on my experience if you plan on making extensive use of the USB connection.

Overall, I am extremely happy with these headphones, and they get daily use from me, often for hours on end.",Awesome Sound; A Bit Buggy; Still Recommend,1389830400,,,

4.0,False,"12 5, 2007",APOUYO1BEPK22,B000P46NMK,M. B Cole,"After a few days of playing I finally beat the game (gimme a break, I got a job). After the credits start to roll (and boy do they take their time on that one) and after I messed around a little bit in the lab room, I put the controller down and thought to myself, ""Wow...I really really want to keep playing."" Very few games have made me feel like that in the 20+ years I've been gaming.

When I first popped the disc in, I was expecting a fun game, but with a lot of faults. Mainly collision errors when trying to find spots to climb up buildings or trying to jump from building to building, but not doing it correctly and just falling. Surprisingly, this didn't happen once for me. Watching Altair (that's you), run into a building and seamlessly running up the wall a few steps and then grabbing either the top of it, or a loose brick, or a nook, or just about anything, and then pull himself up is just amazing looking. Then when I saw something that jutted out a little bit overhead of me, I immediately thought, dang, I'm gonna have to move to the left or...wait a sec...NOPE, he's actually removing himself from the wall a little bit and jumping or pulling himself out and over it. Very nice. Then when I got to climb my first 'high point' in a city, and hit the 'Y' button to investigate the area, my mouth actually dropped open and I said to myself, ""Wow, I can actually go anywhere in here?!"" Even my World of Warcraft addicted roommate removed himself from his computer to watch me play this game for a few hours.

The story itself, at first was pretty boring for me. Or maybe it was just cause I didn't care about it cause I just wanted to go go go and keep playing. After awhile I started listening in on the story, and it proved pretty interesting, ESPECIALLY closer to the end.

The controls are very very easy. You've got the nonchalant mode where mostly what you do is look inconspicuous by pressing 'A' to look like you are a scholar and praying, or pressing 'B' and gently shoving people out of your way and so on. Then you got our attack mode where you can run 'RT', or attack 'X', sprint 'A'. It's really very simple. Which can be a bad thing and a good thing. Good thing is that it makes it very simple and everything flows very nicely..like the graphics. Bad thing is, well, it's simple. Some people like to be able to hit button combinations to create spectacular moves or really just have their own kind of freedom on how to attack. I'm usually in the latter here, but this time I liked the simpleness. It made it a lot of fun without having to be to frustrating, especially when I would bust up a soldier party (<--future rap title I bet!), kill a couple, and then haul butt to another party, and then another, and then have to kill about 40-50 guys at once. Talk about feeling like a bad ASSassin! Wow..bad pun...whatever.

The missions are fairly simple...and pretty repetitive after awhile. You show up to town, head to your little headquarters, find out what's going on, climb some towers, find more stuff going on, then go pick pocket, eavesdrop, save some people, beat some info out of people, and then go assassinate the 'boss'. That's how it goes. Now don't get me wrong though, it sounds a little tedious, but for some reason it was not at all for me. I enjoyed every minute of it. Ok I lied, I didn't enjoy the eavesdropping and the pick pocketing. You stand or sit there, listen to the convo, and then leave or you have to pickpocket a guy and then leave. That was pretty boring after the 2nd time of doing it. But everything else was fun to me.

Once the ending happened, like many people, I was left a little confused. I checked online and found a lot of info that made me go 'Ahhh..ok'. Plus I found out that this was the beginning of a trilogy. Yummy Yummy! I can not wait for the next installments and go a treasure huntin..YAAAR!

One thing that REALLY irritates me about the game is you can not hit a button to skip through the story. Now if the makers want me to sit through it, then that's fine, but make me do it only once. If I've made those credits roll, give me the option to skip through the dialog the next time I play through. Cause some of these scenes can get pretty long winded. I made a bowl of spaghetti-o's during one scene.. =\

I missed it originally for the XBOX 360/PS3, so I thought this would be the ideal version to pick up. As this was being released by Square Enix I thought the upgrade would be similar to that of the Tomb Raider release, which was amazing! Unfortunately this seems to be only slightly better than the version released a couple years ago, with minor visual updates. At $59.99 it is a hard pill to swallow, especially since Naughty Dogs released The Last of Us at $49.99 which was a nicer refinement in my opinion. There are also small things that really get annoying, like the camera angle during certain aspects of the game. Those who played the game on the previous generation say that most of those issue were also present the first time around. Not sure why it wasn't cleaned up. Overall it may be the closest contender to Grand Theft Auto. Having it set in a completely different culture, rather than state or time frame really makes it unique!

I believe they supposedly fixed this issue with a recent patch, but I'm not sure because I was already at the end of the game anyways.

They did add some nice features tho, but at the same time, they did take away some other things that I liked. For one, each weapon in Fallout 3 had a unique counterpart/version, but in Fallout NV, only a few guns have unique versions. Also, just my preference, but I do like the storyline of Fallout 3 better than Fallout NV. This whole tribes/factions deal in NV is cool, but it sorta feels a bit useless.

4.0,True,"04 4, 2016",A1H7DHMKP8H267,B00DEL3IIS,Krisr2005,"I'm a big gamer, and I recently got into the MMO scene after largely ignoring multiplayer gaming for a majority of my life. Besides WoW I pretty much played single player games. That all changed with Destiny, and after I did everything that could be done, I searched for my next fix. From its early on, The Division felt like it was marketed to the Destiny guys that ran out of things to do and wanted a a solid MMO gaming experience with plenty of things to do, and the Dark Zone to keep players hooked.

The gameplay is solid, if not a little uninspired. Shooting feels a little bland, aiming isn't as tight as it feels like it should be. This could just be my problem, however. Once I started reaching higher levels and getting better weapons, this got a little better; I don't know if I got more skilled or the weapons alleviated some of those issues, or a combination of both. The cover mechanic functions as well. I found myself pulling out of cover on accident and getting nailed, but with time, I got much better with paying attention to what I was doing. Enemy AI seems competent. You have particular enemies that employ particular strategies. For instance, there are ""brawler"" types that will rush you hard with a bat or a shotgun. You've got your typical cover fire shooters, the occasional sniper, and then your elite guys which can fall in any category but have the added benefit of additional health and armor. The enemies are bullet sponges, but not so much to a fault. I would say that have the right amount of health to allow them to deploy strategic attacks on your group without feeling overpowered in the process.

The Division's structure and systems are elaborate, and you'll probably feel overwhelmed once you make it to the Manhattan for the first time. Everywhere you walk your map is bombarded with objectives; phones ringing, agent locations, encounters, main missions, etc. There's an initial shock of all this stuff to do, and feeling overwhelmed about where to even start. Once you get going, it gets really engaging. Matchmaking is excellent. It just works. I haven't had a single issue finding a team to tackle a mission or just do objectives around the map. It seems like there's a good amount of content built into the base game, but there will be those gamers that blow through all this content in no time; in fact I'm sure there's plenty that have already done so by the time I write this review.

Visual/Audio presentation is top notch. The graphics are really good. But more importantly, the ambiance and detail are remarkable. A lot of heart went into making this game look like it does. Everything is so deliberate, each room, hallway and alley has a story to tell. There's no copy and paste asset creation here; not that I could tell anyway. The attention to detail goes above and beyond what I've seen in many games in years past. In a lot ways, it reminds me of the experience I had playing Bioshock for the first time- from the aspect of attention to detail. Sound is equally as good. The ambient music blends methodically in the background; exactly what you want it to do- it adds intensity when needed and fades away while you're taking a walk through Times Square. The sound effects are great- I particularly like the satisfying crunch of a headshot with a marksman rifle. From a presentation perspective, this game gets a 5/5, no doubt about it.

The one part of the game I cannot comment on as of yet is the Dark Zone. I understand this is a huge draw for the PvP crowd, and offers a ton of great rewards for those to go exploring through it. I just haven't ventured there just yet, I'm level 17 at the moment, and I'm still enjoying the PvE and the world's ambiance.

I'd definitely recommend this game to those that were big fans of Destiny, I can see it catering to that gamer easily. As a big single player gamer, I'd also encourage other single player gamers to give The Division a try. It's a blast to play by yourself, but I find it to be so much better playing with a group. I personally play almost everything with a group, unless I'm out exploring or trying to pick up some of the collectibles throughout the environment. If you knew me, you'd know how much of a compliment this is to The Division- to get me to WANT to play with others. It's a great game, a fun way to pass the time, and a heck of an experience so far.

*It is a lot like Oblivion (which is another favorite game)
*It pays homage to it's roots (Wasteland and Fallout 1&2)
*It offers a unique storyline
*It has unique gameplay (being born & VATS)
*The world is HUGE
*You can NUKE stuff (C'mon..a nuke?...gotta love that!)

Having said all that some aspects, some in common with Oblivion, are tedious. Traveling can be a pain. Bethesda..you offered Horses in Oblivion to speed up travel to un-visited places..why not a steam jeep? Fast travel helps but only after you have traveled and found the location. VATS is good and bad. The good is ability to aim shots for critical damage (vaporizing an enemy with the laser rifle is the beast!). The bad thing is when you are 'potting' at an enemy your hit rate is really low (until you soak enough points in Big Guns or Small Weapons). Since I have the XBOX 360 version I haven't seen any artifacts or glitches (yet). You do get the occasional dead body with twitches (same in Oblivion). This is not a perfect game but some of the reviewers want to compare it with FPS (it's more of an RPG not a FPS game like Bioshock) and that's not a fair match.

I worked there many, many months before it came out and followed the development to the T.  In fact, I had significant contribution to the first patch released for this title.

If you check the date when I am posting this and the date the game was released, you will notice a fairly significant time-gap.  I was recently writing a review for ""Lord of the Rings:Conquest"" and it suddenly dawned on me that Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth was the best Lord of the Rings game ever produced.  I am disappointed in the way the development ran (in the original plan, it was basically like Total War meets LOTR) however this is also one of the best RTS games ever released as well.

There are several different attributes that make this game particularly fun.  The most significant is the differences between the different factions (Mordor, Isengard, Rohan, and Gondor).  Each faction is VERY different from each other and the game does not go overboard trying to make units of different factions similar to each other.  They are VERY different.  Mordor is concentrated solely on numbers.  They produce fast and aim to overwhelm their opponents.  Isengard are few but very strong units.  They dominate in very close combat and can destroy walls very easily.  Rohan (the most fun in my opinion) concentrates mostly on cavalry and speed.  Finally, Gondor takes all three of these qualities and molds it into one.  While each side has their strengths, they also have weaknesses...but I won't give everything away.

Another fun aspect is the special powers you can acquire through experience and a certain number of enemy kills.  These powers range from manipulating the environment, to temporary reinforcements, to the temporary all destructive mega units.

Hero units can be purchased and also upgrade through experience, giving you access to THEIR own superpowers (Gandalf's is awesome).  The cool aspect is that all these powers can overlap and the strategy is simply endless!

Finally, there is less concentration on base building/managing money and more on actual gameplay.  This is very handy when you want to concentrate on using your rohirrim in harassing tactics.

So should you buy it?  ABSOLUTELY!  It has been years since this game has come out and yet it is still enjoyable.  But it on Amazon, buy it in a store, buy it in a garage sale.  Either way, do not miss out on this game.  It actually has one of those rare live-on values which make it fun to play over and over.

4.0,False,"12 16, 2012",A1LHDO3D99UJSJ,B0010AYJXI,Vic 2.0,"This game is phenomenal.  It's not quite Survival Horror.  Indeed, it was marketed as a Thriller and along those lines it satisfies.  I've played it seven times now, mostly for the combat and atmosphere but I also lose myself in the story pretty easily.  So let me elaborate a bit on one of MY top ten games of all time:  Alan Wake.

STORY
Much better than I expected.  I can't think of a survival horror game in which I actually cared what happened to the characters.  To me, I just focused on the gameplay and staying alive, going through the motions.  But Alan Wake is a very story-centered game.  Whether it's in cut scenes, in the narration, in the manuscripts, or wherever, you remain in tune with the narrative and trying to figure everything out.  Alan Wake is a famous author of crime fiction who's been suffering with a bad case of writer's block.  He and his wife take a trip to a small town in the Pacific Northwest presumably to just leave their problems all behind them.  But then Alan's wife goes missing, and the cold eerie nights of this small town present to Alan a problem far bigger than his writer's block!

I won't spoil anything for you, but the plot will keep you guessing right up to (and in fact BEYOND) the end, which of course is what you would expect from horror/thriller.  Just know that the plot gets deep, and it never lets go of you!

PRESENTATION
Bar none!  The game goes for a sort of TV series feel and it's easy to see.  Each level is not called a level but an ""Episode"".  Events are narrated as you play, in between action sequences.  The camera lets you move it so you can see behind Alan as he's running forward, stuff like that.  And I like how in the main menu you can access tons of content you've unlocked.  You can read pages of the manuscript (a book you start writing near the beginning of the game), listen to songs that have played in the game, even listen to radio interviews you've stumbled across while playing.  It's nice.

GRAPHICS
Superb!  Even critics have little bad to say about it.  The scenery is gorgeous, in and out of cut scenes.  Textures are everywhere you want them to be, and the lighting is right on the money.  Now I will admit there is one graphics-related flaw, and that's the facial animations of these characters!  They could use some serious work.  Still, this is a very small part of the game and therefore didn't hinder my enjoyment of it in the slightest.  For the most part, this game is beautiful.

SOUND/MUSIC
Alan Wake has one of the best video game soundtracks I've ever heard.  I immediately went and got a hold of every song I heard in the game, including some very inspired tracks by Poets of the Fall.  Good stuff!  The sound effects are spot on.  Everything sounds as it should WHEN it should, and the audio when you're outside at night is thrilling!

COMBAT
Though the focus in this sort of game is never on the combat, Remedy did pretty well with it in Alan Wake.  What the combat entails, usually, is driving a sort of shield'o'darkness off of your enemies so they become vulnerable to your main weapon (e.g., a revolver, shotgun).  You can also dodge enemies when they get too close (which can happen very quickly if you drop your guard!) and you get some other goodies later on as well.  The appearances of your enemies and their defeat are satisfying, without any blood or gore which was a welcome change for me.

You don't get an endless variety of enemies or weapons.  What you get are changes in Alan's SITUATIONS (usually via inventory changes and environmental tools, traps, etc.) and then later some pretty surprising changes in the environments you end up in as well.  You start the game expecting the gameplay to be mostly stuck in the woods, but you'll end up in a variety of interesting locations the more you play.  As in most shooters, enemy models and ways you'll mostly be taking them down do repeat.  But the game does a great job of mixing it up most of the time so you're never fighting the same enemies the same way for too long.

CONCLUSION
Especially for the price it's going for now, this is a great game!  The story and atmosphere alone are a must-experience for any psychological thriller fan.  The combat is satisfying though not on par with full-on action shooters.  It won't scare the hell out of you like Survival Horror games, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you wondering who's who, what's what, why and everything in between!",Very solid game.,1355616000,,,

Alot of people are reporting having problems with the 8-headed monster that is Steam. I hate the whole guilty-until-proven-not-so-guilty application as well, but I had no problems setting it up. BE WARNED: you need a GOOD internet connection or else you might as well forget it. Once I got my game registered, it did not bother me again. Other people complained about the multi-player; hacking issues, bad connections and such. I don't do multi-player, playing the single-player missions only.

Besides Steam, how is the game? Stuff blows up REAL good! It was everything that I was expecting: simple controls, good graphics, great fire-fights and great weapons. Like the first game, you get to play soldiers on multiple fronts in different tactical situations. Sadly, there are no AC-130 Spectre missions; they are replaced with the ability to control Predator drone strikes. They are alot of fun, with the added danger of accidentally bombing yourself. *BOOM*

The first game gave you the opportunity to wield the awesome chain gun once; CODMW2 lets you cut loose with this weapon multiple times. Chop-chop-chop-chop, Whoopee! There are multiple chase missions in the game too; I relly liked the snow mobile chase, very sweet. Later in the game, WWIII breaks out and you are stuck in the middle of it. Nukes get lobbed in this game as well.

Bottom line: if you like bloody fire-fights, sniping and conspiracies then this game is for you. Casual gamers will also like this game as well.","Great, Despite Steam *Not for kids*",1270425600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It took the extraordinarily fun and detail-oriented action-RPG gameplay of  the X-Men Legends series and took it to new heights with dozens of playable characters from every corner of the Marvel Universe with unique abilities and powers and a story that was not only epic enough to fit them all in, but had several possible endings depending on your actions, a customizable superteam option that allowed you to handpick your favorite characters and form a grouping of heroes with their own identity, and much more of the stuff that comic fanboys dream about such as multiple costumes for each character that had varying ability boosts.  Surely a sequel would offer even more awesomeness while keeping everything we loved about the previous game.  Surely.
Or not.  ""Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2"" takes a whole lot from us and offers us precious little in return.  It's still awesomely fun to play, but the little things that are missing really hurt.  Thankfully, the massive Civil War storyline that split the Marvel Universe down the middle over the Superhuman Registration Act translates extremely well to video game form and this title still kicks loads of ass.

So what's missing?  Well, there's only one unlockable alternate costume for each character whereas the first had 4.  Petty, I know; but how about  the over 30 playable characters (on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gold-Edition/dp/B000OPPR22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gold Edition</a>, that is) being whittled down to 24?  25 total if you got the pre-order code allowing you to unlock The Juggernaut (and I did).  Among the MIA are Ghost Rider,Blade, Elektra, Moon Knight, Dr Strange, and Silver Surfer.  And not only are they not playable, they aren't even in the game at all. Spider-Woman, Black Panther, and Colossus are present but not playable. And this list of omissions is not counting the amazingly great extra downloadable characters from the last game that were included in the ""Gold Edition"" re-release of MUA.  But at least you get to play as Penance.  Because I know everybody thinks ""Penance"" when they think of the ultimate Marvel superteam of their dreams.  Speaking of superteams, that option is completely gone as well.  And still no Namor, Vision, or Punisher (yes I know about the licensing thing).  And each of the fewer characters only has 4 powers total compared to the original's 6 or so.  Also, the totally killer individualized grappling attacks are replaced with generic throws in the new game.  As if The Invisible Woman would lift a robot above her head and throw it across the screen.  Ugh.  In the first game she'd turn invisible and pull a sweet judo move on a confused enemy.  That sort of thing was great. Speaking of Sue Storm, I was also sorely disappointed that you can no longer control telekinesis-type attacks the way you used to. Those were my favorite, jerks!  And whereas before you could equip each hero with their own set of ""medals""  which would boost their powers in various ways, this time you may have only 3 equipped.  And there are over 200 to choose from.  How likely are you exactly to equip a medal that increases your team's fire damage when The Human Torch is pretty much the only character who'd benefit from such a thing?  THINK, DAMN YOU! It would make perfect sense if you could equip characters individually, but you can't so what the hell? Lastly, while there are still simulator mission you can play, they amount to little more then time trials.  The last game had personalized missions for every character where you had to go solo which was a great feature for learning each character's strengths outside of the chaotic group combat.  Those are sadly gone as well as are the multiple endings. A lot to be ticked off about here.

Now I know that is a mighty big list of grievances, but I'm here to tell you that this game is still loads of fun.  Here are some improvements.  First off, the in-game graphics are amazing.  Each character's textures are very lifelike so they look much more realistic as opposed to the comic bookish look of the last game.  Second, the voice acting is much improved in that the game doesn't mix text-only and spoken bits as sloppily as the first game.  However, in the base sections prior to each mission your character is annoyingly silent when conversing with your allies.  However, you do get to choose from one of three responses on any given topic of conversation (one aggressive, one diplomatic, and one defensive) which is a great idea.  Also, every character has individualized dialog, which is great.  For example, when I was asked to either register my identity and become a dog of the state or escape and fight for freedom for all people, I was controlling Deadpool (my favorite comic character ever) who broke the 4th wall in hilarious fashion by explaining my non-fascist choice of non-registration to the confused SHIELD director by stating that he can always register on the second playthrough.  That was killer.  Every character seems to have their own personalized reaction to these scenarios which is actually really impressive.  You'd have to play through this game dozens of times to see all of the dialogue for every character.  I don't see that happening, but it's a nice thought.  The Stan Lee cameo is fun.  New playable characters include the much-aligned previously-mentioned Penance, Songbird (who is awesome),  Jean Grey, Iron Fist, Green Goblin (surprisingly awesome), Gambit,  and an all-new version of Nick Fury that does not impress me in the slightest.  Hulk and Venom also made it from the Gold Edition, which is good.

Then there are the ""fusions"".  This is the premiere new feature of the game  and it allows any combination of two characters to do a team-up attack that combines their powers.  For example, Storm might summon a tornado you can steer  to suck up enemies while Deadpool tosses grenades into the vortex, Gambit can embed charged playing cards into a chunk of concrete that The Hulk rips out of the ground and then then smashes onto a spot of your choice, or Iron Man can reflect a beam off of Captain America's shield to create a prism effect that takes out all enemies in the vicinity.  This is really a great feature.  Problem is, there are a large percentage of ""stock"" fusions that are repeated with numerous character combos.  For example, Juggernaut and Thor's fusion is the same as Ms. Marvel and Hulk's fusion and Venom and Luke Cage's fusion and so on.  It doesn't exactly ruin the fun, but more creativity would be in order considering they pointed at all the individualized power fusions as being a reason there were less characters in this game.

So basically, if you thought MUA was game of the year material, you are still going to have a great time with this.  It's essentially the same gameplay and concept.  The story is excellent and being able to choose your path (and allies) makes for good replayability.  And can you say ""4 player co-op""?  Sure to be a crowd-pleaser.  Plus whooping Hank Pym is something I've wanted to do for a long time now.  Busting a Spidey/Wolverine webbing fastball special into his gut and seeing the giant stumble back clutching his boo-boo was mucho gratifying.  Like I said, it's the little things.  Sadly, to many of those little things are missing for this to compete with it's predecessor.  It's still a great game and if the first one had never come out, I'd rate it 5 stars in a second; but I just cannot abide the massive amount of great features and characters that were dropped from this game.  That just should not happen.  Ever.  Less is never more in a game like this one.  I'm definitely playing through it again, but I'm going to wait for the inevitable downloadable character pack.  There'd better be Bullseye, Magneto, and Nightcrawler too. And Psylocke.  And Emma Frost.  Yeah, so I'm an X-Men fan; sue me.

Final verdict: MUA2 is a must-play for Marvel maniacs, but it pales in terms of fanboy wealth compared to the previous game.","Improvements are offset by exclusions, but still insanely fun.",1254787200,5,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

However, the one thing many of the ""gaming"" headset community does do better is build quality. I don't know why headsets still come with this plastic/fake leather/whatever this material is on the earcups and headband. It doesn't hold up well to grease/sweat (eww, blah blah blah, but if you're gaming, you're likely wearing these for extended periods of time).

I've gone back to ""gaming"" headsets due to this issue (last one was the Hyper X; it was super comfortable without any of this pansy material Sennheiser likes to use-ie: used cloth instead of fake leather or whatever it is even my grandpa used to use in his headphones, but the sound quality compared to a good pair of cans like Sennheisers was atrociously bad-mostly on the high end of the spectrum), but I always return to Sennheiser's when they're on sale. The sound quality difference is too big, and unfortunately, it's one of those things where once you're aware there's better sound, you really can't go back.

It's possible the more expensive gaming headsets have as good sound quality, but I'm not sure that's a risk I'm willing to risk, so I continue to use Sennheisers, while fervently hoping they eventually up their material usage to be as awesome as their sound quality.

And, yes, don't be purchasing these if you or your soundcard don't have an amp. They aren't friendly for the ampless.","Sound quality is MUCH better than most ""gaming"" headsets",1454889600,9,,

It might have seemed even longer to me, because when I got it on the 24th of March PSN also released a Systems Update. So I had to wait for that to download/install. I started the game. RB6V2 had a patch (1.10). So I had to wait for that to download/install (this one was short). After that the game had to install itself. This took about as long as the Sys Update. It was just kind of ironic since I was anxious to get started.

RB6V2 is a good sequel. I had tried out the first, and it was just ok. The sequel is more enjoyable in my opinion. The ranking system and the new ACES system that allows for you to gain XP and weapons based on your style of play is a nice / welcome touch.

Within a couple of levels I noticed my ""Marksman"" and ""CQB"" XP rose very quickly as opposed to my ""Assault"" XP. So it depends on your personal style of play. Tag a headshot on a guy through a window while repelling will earn you points toward Marksman, while chucking a grenade into a room will get you well on your way towards the next Assault tier. And every other level rewards you with another weapon; while the Ranking system (total XP) seems to be more geared towards personalizing your character.
I especially liked this feature, and am looking forward to unlocking some features later in the game. Just remember that while outfitting your character, certain camo-styles are NOT appropriate for all terrain/situations!

Nevertheless, that hasn't meant that all racing games are all bad. That has absolutemy been the case with Mario Kart from Nintendo. Since the franchise debuted in 1993 for the Super Nintendo system, it has been recognized as one of the most popular racing games in video game history. Since then, Mario Kart has really scored big for systems like the Nintendo 64, and the Nintendo Gamecube. Now, it is set to show again on the portable video game market. Last time, it really felt a little dismal with Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Game Boy Advance. Can this one score better? Yes it can.

Mario Kart DS for the Nintendo DS handheld, is a highly received game that again finds Mario and his pals into the extreme worlds of racing. This time, the time goes even better than before. The game features 2 seperate gand prixs than just 1. The main surprise is the retro grand prix with tracks from all the earlier Mario Kart games, which is great for anybody who hasn't played the earlier Mario Kart games, especially the ones for the Super NES and Nintendo 64. There is also the DS grand prix's, with 16 new and exciting tracks to play. This time, there is also more to unlock in this game including characters like Daisy, and Dry Bones who recently made a comeback on Mario Superstar Baseball and Mario Party 7 for the Gamecube, and delightful new cars to race.

The sounds and the gameplay is great and just incredible fun to play.

If you own a Nintendo DS game system, this is one game you can't help but buy. Mario Kart DS is a pure racing delight for all gamers, and adds on to what Nintendo has built behind Mario and friends' checkered flag.

Appearance wise- this looks awesome!
The resistance on the triggers and the buttons (RB & LB) is little less than the original Xbox controller, but I think I will be okay with it.
There is more resistance on the left trigger than the right trigger. Also, the feed back on ""X"" button is weaker than the other three. And no, it's not because my right hand is the dominant hand. I felt these as soon as I held it and started pushing buttons.
Another thing I noticed was that the finish on the right side corner is not smooth (the part where your palm touches); the bottom piece sticks out about 1mm outward. It's very very very subtle and it seems soooo insignificant, but I can feel it. I think anybody can. So every time I re-position the controller in my hand, it irritates me.
On the positive side, it has small button on the back. You can turn the light off if you want. It has on/ off/ active mode you can cycle through.
It looks sick paired with my laptop. Overall, I am happy with this new controller. It's almost perfect, but not 100% though.

Edit- After playing for couple hours I noticed one more thing that's different. It's the position of the ""Start"" and ""Back"" buttons; they are farther away from where they used to be. I'm still having hard time getting used to it. I use those buttons a lot for the game I play.

The downside is that the graphics technology used in the game would have looked OK ten years ago, but is almost laughable today. Supposedly, motion capture was used, but if so, I would love to see the woman who modeled for Samantha actually walk in real life - some kind of a weird gate!

Nonetheless, you can accept the graphics as ""artsy"" and just focus on the story and the puzzles which are reasonable, varied and challenging enough to make you think, but not hard enough to require regular reference to a walkthrough. One of the interesting gameplay twists in this adventure is an option to turn on labels that identify all the available hotspots. This eliminates the often annoying search for some point on the screen that you need to touch with your mouse that often damages the experience on most adventure games. Another clever trick is the available bar graph display that shows your current level of accomplishment for each chapter. This together with a hi-light on each available location allows you to avoid endlessly traveling point to point to point trying to discover what clue you overlooked.

Other, more theftier, autoier, grandier sandbox games have made a hardturn for realism like an obese fellow who almost missed the turnoff for McDonald's. Volition says ""To hell with that!"" and heads on over to cartoonville and kills various characters gangland-style while wearing a hotdog suit. And that is what is so interesting about this series.

While I loved GTAIV - and I will reinforce the fact that that game was an amazing audio/visual masterpiece, I felt there were times where Rockstar purposefully left many things out from past games because it was not cohesive with their new M.O. Gone was the tank, the missile-launching gunship, ammo counts that reach into the tens of thousands, many of the more outlandish weapons, the rich character customization, and plenty of other features I can't even count yet. But Saints Row 2 continues that line of thought - in many ways this is a direct sequel to San Andreas. The list of activities available to the player is staggering. Some are more immersive than others, but all are worth a go or two in hopes you will unlock some reward (such as infinite ammo for a certain weapon set, or custom vehicles or clothing). You can hop into a septic truck and spray liquid feces on everything you see, strip naked and flash your willy in the eyes of every geriatric coot you come across, bring in cars to a chop shop, assassinate key people for various undesirables, take control of rival gang territory, shoot it out with police, sell drugs, steal prostitutes from rival pimps, have sex for money, buy every store you come across, customize whatever vehicle you want, imitate the police in a COPS-style documentary, escort prostitutes while they entertain their customers, race around the city, and many, MANY other things.

This to me shows that volition really let their minds go wild when they were making this game. They don't let realism clog the fun artery, realism is for the Sims, let's go throw flame on people! And this permeates into every facet of the game, not just the things you can do. Vehicles control like you would expect an arcade racer, and health regenerates automatically - meaning you won't be panicking so much when your being sniped from a helicopter.

However, this game is not without it's faults. The main story is almost completely forgettable, the only interesting characters are returning from the first game and the new faces we meet aren't very charismatic or interesting to watch. In many ways the setup is the same from the first one - As a member of the 3rd Street Saints you must take control of the city from the three color-based gangs that currently control. It's basically a mix of tattooed steroid junkies in trucks, Kill Bill wannabes on motorcycles, and rastafarians in sedans. It's obvious each gang is tailor-made to have their own identity and environment, and in some ways it's a bit funny watching them be systematically killed off by you and a couple ""homies"". I would have appreciated a better way to move the story along, but I guess they were too busy programming the septic truck. The only real inticing plotline is a secret mission at the very end of the game that answers several questions about the first game's conclusion - I wondered why they went to such lengths to make it so secret, it was the best part by far.

But the way this game flows, the main story is almost a distraction from all the distractions you can engage in. I almost couldn't wait to finish it so I could get back to hurling myself in front of cars for the insurance money. At the time of writing this, I am 93% complete in the game, and the rewards I've unlocked are really good at increasing replay value: infinite ammo, infinite sprint, double health regeneration, my own Armored Personnel Carrier, jets, boats, heat-seeking RPG's, flamethrowers, a walking can that is also a shotgun (although I still have a soft spot for the sawed-off), an assault rifle with a grenade launcher attachment. I know I'm just listing things here, but that is what a sandbox game is about - all the little tools at your disposal to do what you want with. I've put in close to 70 hours of gametime and I'm still finding stuff to do. And while I really don't care much for the hip-hop scene or style, I like being able to create and make my character look how and act I want them to. The soundtrack of this game is hit-or-miss, mostly miss. I don't like rap and their metal selection is a who's who of crappy metalcore losers. But I found the addition of classical music a funny little touch - nothing like Beethoven to give a drive-by shooting a much-needed touch of class.

Having said all that, there are some things about this game that get under my skin and make me itch. For one, pop-in is HORRENDOUS in this game. Cars and pedestrians will simply vanish into thin air or materialize out of nowhere - especially if you are traveling at a high speed or altitude. Several times a car would drive past me, and when I turned around to go after it - it was gone! As soon as something is off-screen the game engine gets rid of it to make room for all the other stuff it has to juggle to keep the game running. I also had a couple freezing events, I didn't lose any progress because the game autosaves religiously, but it's still annoying when your watching a cutscene of a haitian assassin getting his ear cut off when everything STOPS. Also, the A.I. is one level below stupid; I lost count of how many times my buddies would blow themselves (or me) up with an RPG they stumbled upon. At first it was funny, then it got aggravating when I was watching my friendlies like a hawk to make sure I didn't have to kill them if they picked up a rocket launcher. I wish I was kidding.

But to be fair, these issues aren't nearly as detrimental to the fun to be had here as you may think. It's still a blast watching your character kill almost everyone they come across - both in cinematics and by your own doing. And I love finding all the little hidden goodies tucked away for you to stumble across.

All in, this a game that really takes advantage of the genre. No realism, no going bowling, no eastern european soldiers out for revenge, and no realism. Just a fun old time.","Everyone, let's be civil...",1295481600,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

4.0,False,"06 10, 2004",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00021HBAE,Tsanche,"The Legend of Zelda Four Swords Adventures is quite different from the past Zelda games.  But as far as games go, this one will probably convince you to go out and get that GBA connectivity cable.
If you're familiar with the story of the Four Swords on the original GBA version that was with The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past then you'll probably be familiar with the story in this.  The game starts off with the wind sorcerer Vaati kidnapping Princess Zelda and the other six maidens that watch over his prison. Link decides to grab the Four Sword which divides him into four versions of himself. These four Links now have to go save the six maidens as well as Princess Zelda.  While the story isn't as breathtaking or in-depth as other Zelda games it still has the scale of a good story.
The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures takes a different path from your basic Zelda quest.  The game is divided into levels that each take 45-60 minutes to complete.  The difference however, and I'm not to fond of it, is that you start every level with four hearts and your basic equipment.  You find power-ups and heart-containers in each level but once you complete one level you lose it all.  At the start of the next level you go through it all again.
If you remember, the original Four Swords on GBA stressed multiplayer.  This one doesn't. In fact, whether you play it on Multiplayer or not makes no difference in the flow of a level.  This game more stresses cooperation with your fellow Links.  Most puzzles require all four Links to do his part. The Links might have to stand on four switches at once, or push a large block.  On single player mode you'll be the classic forest green Link leading all the others through the levels.
But where the game shines is its connectivity bonuses.  Most Gamecube games connectivity are used to unlock secrets, this one however is different. Every time you enter a bulding, cave or some sort of subdungeon or go through a moon gate the action changes from your TV to your GBA screen.  This takes a moment to get used to but after a while its as easy as finding the buttons on your controller.
The good news is that you do not HAVE to link up with your GBA to unlock with The Four Swords Adventure has to offer. In fact, the GBA only heightens the experience.
The graphics for this game can sometimes be appealing but you have to wonder sometimes.  Most of the graphics are a mix between the original Four Swords on GBA and Gamecube graphics.  It's almost like putting in the original Four Swords on a Gameboy Player. Sometimes the graphics disappoint, especially if you didn't like the cel-shaded look for the Wind Waker.
The Sound is classic Zelda music.  In fact, throughout Four Swords there isn't a single tune you haven't heard in one of the past Zelda games.  Most of the tunes are taken from the Windwaker.  Most tunes you've heard in previous versions before.  The music is great but be warned that none of it is really new. The theme is the same and you still here the same notes when you unlock a secret that you've been hearing since the first Zelda game.
The Four Swords Adventure is actually a pretty pleasing Zelda game.  Though it is by far the most different of the series it couldn't hurt to by it, link up with a couple of friends and play.

  This is a great mouse and an excellent mmo mouse.  The buttons are easy hit and recognize because each button has a unique shape and in placed ergonomically.  the ring finger button or g key can be changed to any button including modifiers like alt which effect both the thumb buttons and your keyboard.

I have a non laser optical mouse from them and it's a great mouse but being more comfortable with this mouse ends up making it better for me.

-High quality parts.
-Easy to reach and tell which thumb button you're using
-Responsive
-Easy set up

G KEY::
Some say to get rid of it but I disagree.  It's a great idea, (not to modify mouse buttons, but to modify keyboard buttons) though you have to get very used to the mouse before using it, updated ergonomics would fix that.

TLDR::
If I can get used to the feel, I will use this over my naga.  The construction quality, contoured thumb buttons, and placement of the G key as an alt key modifier for my keyboard is too great to pass up.","Best option for mmo mice, very good for fps",1343692800,10,"{'Color:': ' Black', 'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'}",
4.0,False,"10 10, 2003",AQMWZIH22R6LE,B00005NOFM,TwistaG,"Over the past three years, Activision's Tony Hawk franchise has consistently proven to be one of the best action sports series on every platform it has appeared on, which currently tallies up to eight, and each sequel has been different enough and fun enough to keep bringing players back for more. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is no exception and is probably the only Game Boy Advance game to truly usurp Tony Hawk 2. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 plays just how you'd expect Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 to play, albeit from an isometric perspective. In the single-player mode, you'll skate around different locations, completing various objectives to progress to the next level. You're given a choice of 13 real-life pro skaters, and there is also a create-a-skater option, which lets you alter the skin tone, shirt, pants, shoes, and tattoos of your skater. The objectives you'll have to complete include three different score objectives, as well as collect letters to spell the word ""skate,"" find a hidden tape, and meet a slew of level-specific goals that range from delivering airline tickets to a family in the Airport level to grinding specific rails in the LA level, which triggers an earthquake and changes the terrain of the level. There's actually a fair amount of level interaction like this in Tony Hawk 3, though it isn't quite as deep as that found in the console versions of Tony Hawk 3. What it does offer makes the gameplay experience a bit more enjoyable. Out of the six levels in the game, two of them are competition levels, in which the objective is to score as many points as you can with as few bails as possible in the allotted time limit. The gameplay is essentially identical to that of Tony Hawk 2 for the GBA, though there have been a few noteworthy changes. The default control configuration assigns nollies and flip tricks to the left shoulder button, grinds to the A button, jumps to the B button, and grab tricks and the revert to the right shoulder button, but it can be customized to your liking. Yes, Tony Hawk 3 features the revert, a handy maneuver used to integrate vert tricks into the middle of combos. Unlike Tony Hawk 2 for the GBA, Tony Hawk 3 has four different multiplayer modes. Horse, the game in which each player attempts to match the previous player's trick, can be played with up to four players using a single GBA. The three link cable modes are trick attack, tag, and king of the hill. Trick attack is a simple score-based competition, while tag and king of the hill are essentially reversed versions of the same game, in which players either try to stay away from the skater who's ""it"" or take the crown away from the skater who's the ""king."" Multiplayer games have always been a staple of the Tony Hawk franchise, and the modes included here are just as fun and playable as in any other incarnations of Tony Hawk.
Tony Hawk 2 still stands as one of the sharpest-looking games for the GBA, and Tony Hawk 3 improves upon it. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, giving you a wide overview of the level around you. The skaters are 3D polygonal models that are expertly animated and represent their console counterparts beautifully. And while the skater models in Tony Hawk 2 were textured with flat colors, in Tony Hawk 3, they have simple but effective textures that bring them just a bit closer to replicating the real thing. The levels also look great, though the isometric perspective can still sometimes be cumbersome. Vicarious Visions has smoothed out the formula a bit since Tony Hawk 2, so the view doesn't create quite as many frustrating moments. Vicarious Visions has also done a great job of re-creating the sounds of Tony Hawk on the Game Boy Advance. All the skate sounds, from your trucks grinding a rail to the roll of your wheels over concrete, have been sampled directly from the console versions, and all the effects sound sharp. The game features a soundtrack of digital renditions of numerous songs from the Tony Hawk 3 soundtrack, though the selections are almost entirely guitar-based songs, making the soundtrack slightly less appealing if you don't like rock. The tracks are surprisingly true to the source material, but some get a bit muddled in the translation. With the great impression that Tony Hawk 2 for the GBA made on many gamers, Vicarious Visions could have easily just thrown the Tony Hawk 3 levels into the same exact game and still have a quality title. Instead, it went the extra mile and included an improved trick system, improved graphics, multiplayer support, and a create-a-skater mode, creating an exceptional game and maintaining the Tony Hawk tradition of perpetually creating better games. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 used to be the must-own action sports game for the Game Boy Advance. Meet the new titleholder.","Just like the PS version, only smaller",1065744000,,,

It is a well designed and presented game that offers a fun (but short) campaign on lower difficulties and has unlimited replay value with stellar multiplayer. having said that let me explain why I (an avid gamer) did not give CoD4 5 stars.

On the lower difficulties this game plays like a movie. Every firefight (unrealistically so) is about as intense as Omaha beach. At lower difficulties this is actually fun simply because everythings blowing up and getting shot around you but you're not actually dying. You can fight your way through the levels and at the end you will say ""that was cool."" However, do not expect to be challenged at the lower difficulties. The game is so easy that it is basically like watching a movie that you have some say in, you know that you're going to win and survive you just need to let it play out.

At higher difficulties it is completely the opposite. The ""AI"" (not really AI but more like scripted shooting bots) not only knows where you are, but could put Delta Force / SAS soldiers to school if they were actually real. Not only is there incredible ability to aim while on the run very annoying, but their aim is so good that you essentially die in one shot. The traditional call of duty formula is you get shot 5+ times in quick succession and you die without resting. While that formula has not changed, the incredibly accuracy of your opponents on high difficulties is such that if they hit you once, 9/10 times they will hit you 5 more times.

You can even sprint and some guy in a helicopter 500m up in the air and about 800m away from you will drop you within your first 3 steps. Needless to say, the fun factor severely decreases when you have to play certain mission over 80+ times (no exaggeration, play it if you don't beleive me) on certain parts just to get to the next save point. And yes, you will die over and over and over again if you put the difficulty at all above normal. I wonder if the designers just went for the most frustrating possible design at high difficulties because in that they surely succeeded.

Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen are a revamped up version of Pokemon Red and Blue.  Just five to six years ago Pokemon was THE game to get!  I remember going to school with my gameboy to trade with other ""trainers"" all the time.  This was THE game to own back then.  Of course it isn't so much the same for me now but it is nice when a classic is revived.  Unfortunately for Nintendo, its a shame that they work on a lot of the negative things about the previous games.

To begin, this game is no surprise to the Pokemon fan.  The story has been the same since its release in 1999.  You're a trainer striving to be the best trainer he or she can be.  You go around the world collecting badges from the gyms all over to prove that you're a pokemon master.  As the formula goes, you've got a rival and you fight other trainers throughout the game as well.

The gameplay has since its relase in '99 remained unchanged.  It borrows elements from Ruby and Sapphire, the two on two battles but much like Ruby and Sapphire you don't get to enjoy those kind of battles too often. You run around the field getting into random encounters.  You send a pokemon that you caught in the wild out to battle. You can carry up to six in your inventory at a time.  On the field you can also find trainers to do battle with.

Perhaps what strikes me most about the game is that in battle looks a lot sharper and nicer than in the previous versions.  Battle also paces a lot faster than before and the animations look a lot better as well.

The graphics have been updated to suit the GBA and they're absolutely gorgeous!  They're smooth and look astonishing.  The graphics are crisp and the game doesn't suffer too much from the pixel problem the GBA has.  Very smooth and colorful as well. The only downside to the graphics is once again, in battle the graphics do not live up to the full potential of the GBA. They STILL only twitch to attack and never actually touch their enemy.  In battle also still lacks color and scenery.

The sound, I wish I could say is good.  But since the sound has only been updated to sound sixteen bit, that means its still a little annoying. The sound in the first release wasn't anything to jump around about and this re-release is no different.  Some tunes actually sound a bit more annoying than before.

What has been unique about the Pokemon games is how after you've completed it there's more to do. Once you've completed the game you can catch more pokemon and challenge previous trainers to duel only their pokemon are at higher levels.  You'll more than likely spend more time going through the aftermath of the game than the actual storyline itself.

Every Pokemon fan knows that the only way to completely master Pokemon is to catch 'em all.  That's the reason for releasing two different versions.  The only difference between the FireRed and LeafGreen games is simply the different pokemon you catch.  Some pokemon are no availible in one version and therefore you must trade with the other version.

Perhaps the only BIG con is simply if you've got that brutally mastered file on the original GB version one and spent 200 hours doing it all to get everything you possibly could, you probably won't be too happy to do it all over again on virtually the same game and since you can't bring in your pokemon from the original Red and Blue, some may not be too pleased to have to raise all their pokemon all over again.

Now it might be that I never truly got the hang of the controls the first time around (partially true), whatever the case I just didn't find myself coming back time and again as I expected.

If you owned outlaw golf and enjoyed it (uhhg) this is not the game for you. Tiger Woods 2003 was a great game and for those who own it will be hard to get back to the shot bar method. However if you play in advanced mode you can get rid of the bar.

I think the graphics on links are better. I think the flight of the ball is beautiful. I suggest starting the game in the middle setting.

Lara Croft, Bloodrayne, and Joanna Dark are primary examples of strong female videogame protagonists. Now comes an addition to the roster: Rubi Malone who is the featured gun-for-hire in Bethesda's WET, an highly intense 3rd person shoot em up that may seem derivative as it had borrowed from previous games; stranglehold, tomb raider and even prince of Persia but there's still enough originality to stand out on its own mostly due to the fact that it's one of the first games to pay homage to the grindhouse genre. (Grindhouse are B movie exploitation films that for the most part consist of violent revenge flicks, kung fu films and Blaxploitaation cinema.)

After a few introduction gunfight scenes/playthroughs (the freeway chase comes to mind.) the game's story really takes hold rubi is paid to apprehend an aging mobster's son only to find out that she has been double crossed and is now out for revenge.

The gameplay itself is basically utilizing two hand pistols, shotguns, sub machine guns and a crossbow while demonstrating a few acrobatic skills. (running alongside walls, swinging on overhead bars, rebounding from enemies and navigating a few environmental puzzles.) The more stylized moves you can pull off, the higher your score tallies at the end of each stage.
 (To break the monotony, rubi uses a sword for melee attacks ala kill bill)
 That being said, it's important that you attain a high score so that you can purchase upgrades be it weapons or acrobatic skills. These definitely will come in handy as the game further progresses.

The game itself is very reminiscent of directors Quentin Tarantino, Sergio Leone, Robert Rodriguez, John Woo and to a lesser extent Don Siegel which is a complement within itself. (there's even an Asian rock lounge scene that was inspired by QT's Kill Bill.)
When it comes to aesthetics, despite the cool film scratch filter (it makes the game look as if you were actually playing a Grindhouse movie.) the graphics are somewhat dated and rough around the edges especially in regards to the in game characters. However, the voice acting and especially the psychobilly soundtrack makes up for the lackluster eye candy.

Unfortunately,  WET has garnered a few not so good reviews X-Play had given it two stars but that's nothing new since they are notoriously known for awarding low scores for games that were actually fun. (Darksiders and Jericho come to mind) sometimes, I think they only play most games for under an hour only to give harsh rush judgment opinions.

One caveat, if you are expecting some kind of epic ending you may be in for a disappointment because once you go through a final boss battle that consists of a few quick time events, that's it. Unapologetic and abrupt with a usual question mark before the credits roll. (Great ending song BTW!!)
If you are looking for a bargain priced action shooter, you can't go wrong with this  game. In a oversaturation of shooter games, Rubi is a Diamond in the rough.

4.0,False,"07 29, 2005",AKMJJES6FE2M5,B00005V9Q1,Andrew C.,"I had a lot of fun with this game, much more than I thought I would. Warcraft 3 is a good old-fashion real-time strategy (RTS) game, with a somewhat outdated resource collection model and base-building formula. It also aspires to be a roleplaying game (RPG), thought it is only partially successful. Overall, if you like RTS games, this one is worth a try. However, I found it not to be as good as some of the more recent games, like Rise of Nations and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War.

Gameplay: Warcraft 3 is remarkably like Warcraft 2 in a lot of ways, which is both good and bad. On the good side, it's fairly easy to learn and quite fun for a while. You choose one of four races to play (which are all distinct); gather gold, lumber, and food; build structures and units; explore the map; and conquer your enemies. It's a very typical 1990s-style RTS game. However, Warcraft 3 adds hero units to the mix, which greatly impact gameplay. These units can gain levels as in a RPG-style game and have special abilities. You really cannot win a game without them. Each race has a choice of 4 heroes to choose from (with The Frozen Throne expansion loaded) and there are neutral heroes that can be recruited. The hero model works quite well with the single-player campaign, since it weaves them into a broad story. However, it makes skirmish games a little awkward, since you are required to both build bases and find creeps (random monsters) for your hero to fight in order to gain levels.

The single-player campaign is both quite long and well done. Actually, it seemed a little too long once I played through the original campaign and the Frozen Throne expansion. The story is the typical good vs. evil theme, which gets really hard to follow by the mid-point. However, the missions are generally well done, with a good mix of RPG-style adventuring and a heavy-dose of base-building and conquest. The missions are designed to allow you the chance to play all four races, and I didn't get the sense that they were just practice for multiplayer online games. That is, for solo gamers like myself, Warcraft 3 has a substantial amount of single-player content.

Warcraft 3 is good, but does have some issues. Some of the single-player missions are quite hard and will require much reloading of saved games in order to complete. Still, the AI can be a little lame. There were countless times that my base would be invaded, and my units would not automatically move to fight the enemy. However, AI enemies do fight smart, often first attacking your units that can do the most damage to them. Rather surprisingly, the game does not have a pause feature so that you can look around the battlefield and give orders while pausing. And unlike recent RTS games, Warcraft 3 limits you to very small armies. You'll be lucky to have 20 fighting units at any given time. Additionally, the game just seems behind the times in other ways. The camera doesn't really zoom, graphics are cartoonish, and the micromanagement can be burdensome at times.

As with every other Blizzard product I've played, the game was perfectly stable and well polished, and I came across no bugs or typos. In addition to a single-player campaign that will last around 35+ hours for the average player, there are a large number of skirmish maps included, multiplayer capacity, and a map editor. As usual, Blizzard has supported the game well with patches and new official maps that are downloadable at their website.

Graphics: The typical Warcraft visuals. A bit cartoonish, but with a lot of vivid colors and diverse environments. Spell effects look convincing, and there are day & night cycles that give the world a living feel. The game is actually cute in many ways and is probably supposed to be that way. The graphics will not win any awards, but they do serve their purpose. As with Diablo 2, Warcraft 3 has some of the best cutscenes I have ever seen in a video game.

Sound: There is a lot of great voice acting in the game. Some of it is very funny. The music is also well done and appropriate to the mood of the game.

Overall, I recommend Warcraft 3 (plus the expansion) to anyone interested in RTS or fantasy games. It's a well-made strategy game with lots of challenges, a epic (though rambling) story, and an RPG element in the form of heroes (which, again, can be a plus or a minus). If you can get past all of the micromanagement that the game requires and some other outdated elements, Warcraft 3 should provide many hours of entertainment.",A good old-fashion RTS (with a twist),1122595200,,,

Being stuck as a ""specialist"" and all the players limited to just them is so totally redundant and boring, It is the only flaw I can find in the game. The multiplayer maps for free for all, deathmatch, etc are pretty horrible in comparison to the MW4 maps, even the DLC sucks and you feel ripped off with the DLC maps.

Most likely gonna be collecting dust in its case until I get totally bored with the call of duty 4 remaster and infinite warfare. With only weeks away from Call of Duty WW2 getting really excited for that, it looks amazing since my favorite part of the campaign was the ww2 type missions.","Great game, except for the multiplayer specialists.",1508457600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

You can see a lot of similarities between the two series  character design, soundtrack, gameplay (social aspect). I would say if you liked the Persona games, give this game a chance as I did.

The game breaks down into a few parts :

1. Anime cut scenes. Sit back and enjoy the scenes as the play out. About 10% of the game.
2. In game cut scenes. This moves the story along between chapters and really focuses on Vincents plight. About 20% of the game
3. Social dialog with characters either at the bar or on the steps between each level. You can ask your friends questions about the girl you are seeing and get input. On the steps in the dream you can learn new moves and more insight into Vincents psyche. About 30% of the game
4. Puzzle solving with cubes and climbing. This is the bulk of the actual game play. You will be manipulating cubes in Vincents dreams to climb to the top. 50%

There are three paths to take as the game progresses  pure (you stay with your girlfriend), evil (you stay with the cheater) and neutral (you live out your life without either). All three paths have three endings  good, bad, and perfect, with the perfect being about 99% the same as good, just with 15 seconds of added cut scene.

Your path is chosen by how you answer texts in the game. If you treat your girlfriend cold and respond to the cheater you will get negative karma points. If you answer your girlfriend nicely and ignore the cheater you will get positive karma points. You will also get an opportunity for karma points between each level when you are asked a yes or no question. Depending on how you answer it will either negatively or positively effect your karma. If you are able to complete the game with the karma gauge exactly in the center, you will end up with the neutral ending.

Your ENDING, is chosen by a handful of questions asked after the last level. Answer however you want to get the good, bad, or perfect ending of the path you have traveled.

So that is the general ins and outs. What did I specifically like/dislike about the game?

Likes:
1. The character design, soundtrack, and dub are all very well done. The characters look great, sound great and the music is catchy. Quite enjoyable
2. The game play is great. I love the social aspect in the bar and getting/sending texts is a unique aspect.
3. The story is pretty interesting with there being some interesting twists depending on how you end the game
4. Good replay value. Many difficulty settings, different endings, and game modes to try out to keep you busy

Dislikes:
1. The game is pretty short. One play through probably won't take you longer than 10 hours.
2. The puzzle solving can be hard and annoying. Lots of trial and error
3. No matter how you play the game, you are always a cheater. The only thing that changes is how Vincent accepts it  or doesnt accept it. There is no way to play the game to NOT cheat.
4. No matter how you play you cant save any of the other sheep people you meet. All the characters you see in the real world will die in the dream world no matter how you talk to them or motivate them. I wish you had more control other than how the game ends.
5. Controls can get wonky when playing the puzzle portion. Sometimes when hanging from a cube, Vincents movements were contrary to what I wanted. I would accidentally drop from a hanging position when I was trying to pull him back up.

The game is pretty fun and falls somewhere between a 3 star to a 4 star game. I would definitely recommend at least getting it on the cheap. I paid less than $20 for it and do not regret it.

The story in Valkyria is average and a bit surreal. The personalities of the characters is a bit cheesy and inadequate when you consider their ""happy go lucky"" attitude in the middle of a war. This however, is not uncommon on Japanese Strategy and RPG games, so it's very easy to look past that.

The beauty of the game is in the refreshing style of the battles, easy to learn leveling system (you level a class, not a particular character- making it easy to swap units in and out), beautiful graphic style (especially on the cut scenes) and generally solid voice over dialog.

The game goes at a decent pace to show you the basics of the combat system. In Valkyria, you plan your strategy from an overhead map view of the battle, but when you are ready to act on your plan, you control each individual unit from a third person perspective. It could be a bit daunting at times on the large scale battles as every turn you won't have enough ""turn points"" to act with every single unit but the game does a great job of educating the user before you get to that point in the game.

If there is one thing I would change, it would be to add one or two more classes to the unit types for the sake of variety, more vehicles and change the tone of the characters behavior on the storyline a little.

--------- (some minor spoilers)
To start off I did like this game. It is a bit straight forward, all the pieces fall into place like your standard RPG. In some parts of the game it did look like the developers were trying to go a bit deeper with the story and character backgrounds but that just kinda falls flat for some reason, Final Fantasty, Mass Effect or Suikoden it it is not. Also around the middle of the game the reason for Eden disappearing involves the messing around with of time. Which to me is where the story starts to unravel a little, the characters talk about 10,000, 30,000, and 50,000 time periods like they were nothing and one of the characters apparently spent about 9980 yrs floating around in space with her robot body guard until she was found by the space pirates. I know its a video game rpg and a fantasy/scifi one at that but still it would have been nice if the last half of the story made a little more sense. The only other complaints I had was the dungeons and the leveling combining process. Mostly the dungeons are the same with different wall paint or backgrounds slapped on, which I didn't really mind because the combat system is great in this game (though it can get repetive because the enimes don't change much either, they just change colors)and I could happily wack away for a couple of hours and come back the next day and do it again. But the problem is that there is only x amount of weapons to combine before combining any more starts to actually weaken your weapon. Which means (at least to me) there is no point to keep wacking away at the monsters. It just gets boring diving to the bottom of the dungeons to find items either you don't need or weaker weapons that can't be leveled and combined because they actually make the weapon you have worse. Like another reviewer said completionists will love this game since there is a ton of treasure chests to find, quarrys to track down, and secrets to find. But if your like me once most your characters have weapon that is in the 300 to 400 dmg range, you'll proably just start running through the dungeons because your levels are high enough that a few whacks will kill anything and if it doesn't you have proably unlocked most of the skills so that will polish the rest off. Which makes the end dungeons very annoying because monsters tend to pop up a lot and the dungeons are loooong. Other than those minor issues this is a very enjoyable RPG that will keep most players entertained and playing to find out how the game ends.
Summary:
Graphics: Bright, clear, and vibrant. Dungeon backgrounds can be a bit repetive.  The CG sequences in this game are definetly worth looking at. Somtimes it suprising they look that good on the PS2.
Contorl/Camera: Works, mostly. Somtimes there is so much activity on the screen its hard to figure out where your character is, also unless you can get the hang of the targeting system its usually better just to hit whatever is close so the character locks on without having to to cycle through all the enemies. This can cause some issues during boss battles.
Gameplay/story: Gameplay is entertaing until the weapon combining and skill discovery limit is hit and then it can become boring repetive. In my case this did not happen till the end so it wasn't a big deal. The story is a no brainer with indications that it could have gone higher and further. Around the middle of the game the scifi aspect kicks in a little and the story gets a little garbled.
Conclusion: I would recommend this game to any one who likes Action RPG's and those who like thier games to have a lot of stuff and secrets to find.

Ah, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, the long awaited sequel that links Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II's stories together. Is the game worth the money? Does it live up to the hype? Relax, that's what I'm here to tell you.

Story

The story of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is an interesting one. The game begins with a cut-scene with some ending footage from Kingdom Hearts 1 and then continues from there. Sora, Donald, and Goofy run down the same path as in Kingdom Hearts and eventually stop at a cross-road. While there, Sora (Donald and Goofy vanish without a trace) is greeted by a mysterious man in a black coat. The man speaks the following: ""Ahead lies something you need, but to claim it, you must lose something dear."" After that, the man vanishes and all of the roads form into one, leading to the equally mysterious Castle Oblivion.

In this castle, the story picks up, and as you proceed through the game, you will uncover a plot of mystery, deception, and depression (I bet some will argue with me on that last part, though) as you travel to worlds you visited in Kingdom Hearts to find Sora's lost memories. (I'd tell you what's that all about, but I'm going borderline spoilers here)

The story unfolds like so: You go to a world, solve the problems of the people living there, fight a boss or two, and leave. When you leave, the main story of the game continues. Since you only have a few scenes in-between every world, you will more than likely want to just skip over worlds to get to the next story bit.

In the worlds, other then the first and final three, all have the same story that they did in Kingdom Hearts. Now, I understand that you are trying to collect Sora's lost memories, but if I wanted to have the stories from Kingdom Hearts, I would just play Kingdom Hearts. The first world, while similar to what I just described, has a bit more than that, so I left it out.

The final three worlds, however, are strictly for developing the game's main story. Thankfully, it is enough to make you not mind that the story is a repeat of Kingdom Hearts everywhere else. In these final three worlds, which I will not name to prevent spoilers, all of the characters either make themselves known, or sink into the background and fade away. By fade away, I do not mean that they had a story bit and were forgotten about after that. =) You'll see what I mean when you reach these worlds.

The story itself, while complex and interesting, is not very hard to follow. If you read the text carefully and go back to read Jiminy's journal entries once in a while, you should understand the game completely, but some may still have trouble comprehending it.

8/10

Good Points:

-Original Story is very well developed

-Plot reminds me of FFT, which is a good thing for those who haven't played FFT

-Introduction of new characters, as well as development of others

Bad Points:

-The story for most worlds is the same as Kingdom Hearts

-The worlds seem just there to play as a way to give you more gameplay rather than story

-Story may be too hard to follow for som

Gameplay

The gameplay of Chain of Memories is rather unique. It uses cards, but doesn't play similar to something like Pokemon Trading Card Game. The cards are your attacks, magic, and summons. Everything you do in the game revolves around these cards.

While roaming around a world, you fight enemies to gain Map Cards, which are used to unlock doors that allow you to venture further into the world. The Map Cards are separated into colors, names, and level.

While it seems like a simple and easy concept, it gets VERY tedious after a small amount of time. Sometimes you must have something like a Red Level 7 card. If you don't have that Red Level 7 Card, you have to fight until you get it. The searching could take anywhere from five minutes to an hour or two. The latter times are more frequent in the later worlds.

During battles, you have attack cards (keyblades), magic cards, and summons. Each of these are separated by level as well. You have things like Level 1 Kingdom Key and Level 9 Oblivion for attack cards, Level 0 Fire or Level 6 Ice for magic, or Level 3 Dumbo and Level 4 Cloud cards (yes, I said Cloud) for summons. You cycle through your cards with the L and R buttons and use the A button to use a card. Level 0 being the weakest and level 9 being the strongest.

That's not all though. You can combine cards by hitting L and R at the same time while on a card. So, say you have three Cloud cards left. You would hit L+R over while on each card, and they will combine into things called sleights. You learn new sleights by levelling up. Now, back to the three Cloud cards example, if you have the three Cloud cards ready to be used, you hit L and R again and Cloud will use an Omnislash. However you can also use two card sleights. So, if you only had two Cloud cards, he would use Cross Slash instead of Omnislash. Naturally, the more cards you have, the more powerful the effect will be. You can also combine things like Cloud, Fire, and Kingdom Key cards for three separate attacks, but in a quicker pace then using them separately.

Don't forget that there are enemy cards too. If you defeat a boss, or sometimes a random enemy, you will get a card based on them. Some will give you things like faster running speeds, while others will give you abilities like Auto-Life.

There is also a feature called Card Breaks. If your opponent uses a sleight, you can use a level 0 card to break their sleight, and make them lose the attack and a card. Your opponent can also do card breaks to you.

Level 0 cards are not the only way to break sleights or attacks. If you create a sleight that has more total points than your opponents, then you will break their sleight and your's will be used. Or if they use a level 5 card, you could use a level 6-9 or 0 card to break it. If both of your cards have the same total points, all cards used would be broken and no one would get a turn.

Since it would be too much to just throw any and all cards in your deck, you have a CP (Card Points) limit. Higher level cards require more CP than lower level cards, so you can't stack your deck with all powerful cards.

Another addition is Premium Cards. These cards require no CP to use, but after used once, can't be reloaded back into your deck. So if you try and use all premium cards, you will run out of cards by the time you have to reload your deck. Not a very good thing.

In terms of difficulty, Chain of Memories is nothing extremely tough. Some bosses will cause you frustration, but it is usually because your deck of cards is unorganized, underpowered, or a combination of both. Like I said earlier, it's all in the cards. All you have to do is change around your deck and you can most likely win.

While exploring the worlds, you will probably notice that every world is the same. All the rooms have the same set up and patterns, with the only difference being the floor tiles and walls. It gets very boring running through the same course over and over again.

7/10

Good Points:

-Very innovative idea

-Bosses require strategy and not senseless button mashing

-Can be fun

Bad Points:

-Very tedious after a while

-Can take hours just to find a single card

-Levels repeat over and over again

Graphics

The graphics in Chain of Memories are outstanding. Quite possibly the best I have seen for the GBA. A nice feature of the game is the adding of PS2 quality cut-scenes. That's right, ps2 quality. You know the graphics that the original Kingdom Hearts had(bar FMV)? Well that's the cut-scene graphics for Chain of Memories.

The attacks and such are smoothly animated, and look really cool, but if there is too much going on at the same time, the game will slow down until everything causing the slow down finishes. I only came across this slowdown two times the entire game, so don't worry about it.

9/10

Good Points:

-Great GBA graphics

-PS2 quality cut-scenes

-Smooth animations

Bad Points:

-Occasional Slow down

Sound

The sound in Chain of Memories is pretty damn good. The battle cries are the exactly the same as they were in Kingdom Hearts, and the same goes for attacks and magic.

The music, while nothing to be frowned upon, repeats throughout the game from start to end, While I enjoy the music, I don't like hearing the same track from the start of the game to the end of the game.

Square did manage, however, to port all the music from the world in Kingdom Hearts over to Chain of Memories, and it sounds pretty good.

They also managed to get the song ""Simple and Clean"" over to the cart as well, voice and all. Very nice indeed.

9/10

Good Points:

-Sound quality very high

-Themes ported over from Kingdom Hearts

-Simple and Clean

Bad Points:

-Songs repeat the entire game

Replay, Length, and Rent or Buy

This game will provide a couple play throughs, I'm sure. Two times is the minimum, if you want to get the full story experience, since there are two different modes, each with their own story. I'm pretty sure you'd want to play through each mode at least twice.

The game provided me with about 12 hours and change of fun. I got it on Christmas, and have already beat Sora's Story, but I hogged the GBA most of the time ^_^.

Rent or Buy? Buy of course. You could probably beat both modes within the five days given, if you rushed, but no one wants to rush a game through just to say you beat it.

Replay: 10/10

Length: 8/10

Rent or Buy: Buy

I had bought (months before) a wii-remote charging station by Nyko, and I nearly ruined my wii-motes. When I was planning on buying the wii-zapper, the design had me confused so I went with a more practical design; which just so happens to be manufactured by Nyko. I liked the reviews on it so I bought 2 of them. When they came, I was happy to see how snug the wii-mote would snap into the chamber, and the weight was spot-on. However, though nobody could have done it better, i found it difficult to play Resident Evil - Umbrella Chronicles simply because you need access to the a button, and occasionally the shake movement would not work. Nontheless, whenever I play a shooting game I have the Perfect Shot pistol right beside me. Even when I'm playing a mini game like skeet shooting on Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games, and Target Practice on Wii-Play, and even a small mini game from mario Party 8. In short, it's a good thing to have with you if you are going to play a lot of shooter games on Wii, which not many people are going to do. It certainly brings more fun into the experience, and it's a lot more useful than those excuses for steering wheels in the racing games. It feels like a gimmick at first, but it grows on you if you play with it enough, and you may find yourself using it, even if the game gets harder by your use of the peripheral... Like RE:UC. ((If you play Umbrella Chronicles, make sure you have the num-chuck to pick up weapons and scroll your inventory. It's hard to use any button on the Wiimote besides the B button which is activated by the trigger.

Some may see the franchises' campaigns as little more than a training ground for the multiplayer, and while historically this not always been true  the Modern Warfare series and the original Black Ops's single-player modes were strong enough to stand on their own  Black Ops 3's offering, in a lot of ways, is built to be exactly like that.

There's still an overarching narrative to fight and die through, and many characters to follow and wait beside while they open doors for you. But the stages themselves feel less like corridors and more like small multiplayer arenas stitched together: co-op is back and as such there's generally always a hub where the action is, surrounded by flanking routes and choke points. A lot of the time it feels less like you're on the frontline of a battle, desperately fighting against the odds for a cause, and more like you're hitting checkpoints to load the next mini-map, mowing down bots while getting used to the weapons. And you will be killing a lot of bots.

Blops 3's story is set in the near future, and the world has of course gone to 5h! t. Environmental disaster, political unease, regional conflict threatening to grow into total war: it's a little like looking out your actual window right now, with one major difference: all the special ops boys and girls who you'll be following throughout the 8-10 or so hour running time are now plugged into a system called DNI, direct neural interface, an all-encompassing AI which enables them to hear each other's thoughts, coordinate their movements better, and use powers called Cores, which essentially turn them into GI Jedi.

Naturally, this all goes awry almost instantly, when a rogue element in the system causes near-catastrophic failure in the minds of certain personnel. These soldiers are now walking hard drives, and they're spewing information about the super-soldier program and the CIA's role in a colossal f*k up like no tomorrow, like a version of Universal Soldier starring Edward Snowden. It's your job to stop them.

Now, this isn't the worst setup in the world, and to be fair to Blops 3  thanks to its decision to have players create their own avatars and be called 'Player' for 99% of the game  it seems like it's attempting to make a point about the series itself, acknowledging in some small way that its characters are mindless drones there for other powers (you) to take control and cause havoc seemingly for your own amusement. Of course given that this is Treyarch this soon collapses under its own weight into sub-Wachowski piffle, including metaphysical experiences with the dead and an ending which features White Rabbit playing.

But there are moments of intrigue, including an extended tutorial which riffs on Source Code's premise. The good stuff, however, is totally and utterly undermined by the script and in particular the characters. Squad-leader and ultra-jock Hendricks  who looks a bit like Bradley Cooper  is always, always swearing, even when the scene doesn't call for it, and this coupled with his intense, over-the-top delivery makes the entire experience seem like you've accidentally wandered into a futuristic remake of Team America. At one point I thought he was going to threaten to make me sh*t all over my own balls.

It's nonsense. But then, aren't they all? Well, yes, although some are better than others at hiding it. Call of Duty campaigns live and die based on their set-pieces and firefights, and sadly Blops 3, despite being the most mechanically complex of all the games, soon descends into a slow drudge through a generic future. Older games worked as they grounded, no matter how loosely, their narratives in settings and conflicts we all know or at least recognise. Here you have 'Super Trees', giant treehouses which provide energy because, well, reasons, and various other forgettable locales.

There is scale to these missions, and at least the world feels appropriately screwed, with ops taking place on destroyed seaboards, or mega cities rendered in Blade Runner-neon. But the action itself is curiously muted: diminishing returns plays a part, but so do your powers. Thanks to DNI you can now see threats  enemy locations, grenade splash damage, 'killzones' where the AI will be firing into  overlaid on your HUD.

It's meant to give you the edge in combat, and it does, but it makes the whole thing feel rote and perfunctory. You don't feel like a super-soldier, you feel like a wall-hacker in Counter-Strike. Coupled with the game's insistence of chucking wave after wave of robotic enemies at you, each of which aesthetically is so unappealing, so un-threatening that it's less death rendered in chrome and more distraction knocked up by Ikea. It doesn't feel like a battlefront: more like you're running through your own debug map, seeing how the AI works. In this case, the answer is not very well: the bots essentially come straight at you at all times with no fear, making it even more of a shooting gallery than it used to be.

DNI is to Call of Duty what Detective Mode is to Batman: something that is meant to aid the player at certain times, but it's too easy to leave it on and focus only on it: there's no need for strategy when you're locking and popping foes that haven't even seen you yet. You can turn it off of course, or minimise its effects, but then, why would you? The game gets marginally more challenging, but it doesn't get much more enjoyable. Even the huge-scale explosions feel phoned in: you're never in danger, you don't care about any of the characters, and the aesthetic design is so sub-Syd Mead, why worry - or even acknowledge - when a building explodes?

So, in Blops 3's case, campaign IS a glorified training mode. It has a hub world where you select your missions (maps), craft weapons, and work on your perks (Cores, which are fun to use  force-choking robots en masse or smashing drones out of the sky with a wave of the hand is fun if lightweight, governed by a cooldown bar and usually used as a last resort). You unlock tokens to buy more perks, hit certain levels to get more stuff, and share your loadouts across modes. There are collectibles, paint jobs, and ranks to pick up, work on, and fight through, but none of it is really memorable: instead it's a forgettable tutorial for a mode you already know how to play.

As for the multiplayer? Is it the best in the series? Well, most would argue that that's mwf2 or black ops 1, but certainly this game isn't the worst. Treyarch delivers a much needed boost to the series, multiplayer. To me the guns are balanced for the most parts and as far as the classes go, well that depends on your play style. There's tons of customizations and tweeks that'll keep you busy for the long haul and plus nuke town is back!

This leaves the player with MORE than enough time to colonize various islands, build up  your citizenry, make money, and progress in structures and technologies.  For some, this is wholly enjoyable, but those looking to swashbuckle and  shoot-em-up minutes after the game starts might be a bit miffed.
The  colony-building portion of the game (and really the main portion of the  gameplay) is very enjoyable.  Detailed, yet not overwhelming (though at  first, you might be a little harried) it strives to provide a complete  picture of starting and maintaining a thriving colony.  Your citizens must  eat, so you must provide them with food (hunters, fishermen, cattle farms).  They need clothes, so you must provide those also (sheep farms, weavers,  textile trade).  And the citizens will have demands (churches, taverns,  alcohol), so ignore those at your own risk.  Trade is vital, or you'll run  out of essential building blocks for empire-building (especially tools!)  and hopefully your island will produce some vital product that you can sell  for an exorbitant amount.

The computer AI is just really dumb. Sometimes it'll stand there and not shoot. Other times it'll watch you be trapped by a zombie and hot help you. But if you have someone playing with you, it just makes this game a lot of fun.

The controls are similar to other RE games. I don't exactly like them, but I knew what I was getting in to. The graphics and cut scenes are pretty good too. And the variety in levels was pretty fun. I liked some of the scenes where you have to just mash certain buttons at the right time. It added a little variety in the game style.  The boss fights were pretty fun too and were unique.

There are a few things I didn't like about this.

1.  Constant loading screens. Be sure to copy this onto your hard drive. It'll make the load screens bearable... otherwise they're quite annoying.

2.  It's not that scary.  I was expecting to be scared a lot more when playing this game, but it just wasn't that scary.  It was mainly running through and just killing zombies.

3.  Difficulty doesn't scale that well as you get better weapons. On our first play through the game was pretty challenging, but then we beat it and went onto the higher difficulty and it was just too easy.

The game was perfect.  Most tag team games have a problem as far as controlling all 3 of them is concerned.  Like Sonic Heroes.  When you run around, you easily lose track of all your other team mates.  in this game, you either are controlling all 3 of them, or else it's the smoothest tag team control ever.

The attacks are fairly simple and very effective, if you could call them attacks.  Yakko, the oldest Warner child, plays a paddleball.  This is probably the only thing that involves actual fighting.  If you've ever seen the cartoon show, you know that there's a policeman named Ralph who's always trying to catch the Warners.  So, you do have some Ralph trouble, so-to-speak.  The only defense you have against Ralph is the paddleball.  There's Wakko, the middle Warner, with a huge wodden mallet.  This is the most used attack in the game.  You have to use the mallet to light bombs and cannons, change courses on 3 or 4 occasions, destroy some stuff that gets in your way, and release weak platforms so you can make a jump onto another platform.  The mallet also presses buttons and releases locks in a very difficult section of level 5.  Though, Wakko can't get EVERYTHING out of your way.  Sometimes you need... DOT.  In the show, Dot squeezes two little squeaky mice and hearts come out (but only on one occasion that i can remember).  In this, she blows a kiss and it is represented as a heart.  When this hits certain items, it will knock them out or move them out of your way.  in one of the bosses, you are actually supposed to kiss it and then switch to Wakko.  Problem there.

Well, I said the game was very perfect but for one minor flaw.  Here it is.  THERE ARE SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE YOU NEED TO SWITCH TO ANOTHER CHARACTER QUICKLY!  lIKE FROM YAKKO TO DOT!  SWITCHING BETWEEN YAKKO AND WAKKO IS EASY BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST PRES THE BUTTON, BUT TO SWITCH TWICE IN A ROW, IT TAKES FOREVER!  IT SHOULDN'T TAKE SO LONG!

Okay, I'm done shouting.  Now, the levels.  There are 5 of them.  Some say there are 6, but I've beaten the game personally and I know that there are not.  The levels are supurb.  All are challenging (some are too challenging though; sometimes you can't figure stuff out), all are creative, and all end with a boss that usually isn't as hard as the level (except for Pinky and The Brain at the end and the level 3 boss).  The srory is so wonderfully creative, it seems like Konami has done it again, acurately potraying a show in a game.  Includes characters like Hello Nurse, Dr. Scratchansniff, Pinky and The Brain, CEO, Godfeather, Pesto, Bobby, Squit, Mindy, Buttons, Rita, and Runt.  I think Slappy and Skippy are there somewhere.

And I'm now re-discovering some of their more recent games over the last 5 years and enjoying Wolfenstein, The Wolverine, and soon Singularity-Reloaded.

Wolfenstein falls in-line with Raven's previous quality and ability to combine everything that makes a fun, involving, accessible game so good by faithfully recreating the dark WWII alternate universe of sorts that has Nazi's toying with ancient mystical powers and creating virtual super soldiers and weapons.  But of course you've got BJ Blaskowitz, who stops them before they go too far, and keeps their evil plots and devices in hidden fortresses and the black market street hoods of Germany, before they're able to be used on Allied troops.

While the story and characters can get a little muddy at times, the premise is quite clear, but the game moves along quickly as you are able to visit black market upgrade shops and if you want, complete missions in the order you choose, but the game still maintains a sort of linear action sequence regardless, so that you don't get lost or confused.

The best part of the game is the action it involves; plenty of explosions, great WWII guns, upgrades, fairly intelligent enemies, intense combat, decent graphics, good lighting, and the game adds a dimension via the ability to go into a special mode that allows you to operate in a different dimension and allows you to slow down time, walk through certain walls, increase your damage and shield yourself, depending on the circumstances you are facing.  Tight alley ways to larger environments, both indoor and outside, give you some variety and tactical situations that keep the game fun and interesting as well.

This is another under-appreciated gem of a game from Raven, and if you are a fan of action FPS games, especially those from the earlier part of the decade, Wolfenstein satisfies.

It is not necessary to play the original Bioshock but you will probably enjoy it more.  Since this is a sequel and the original was extremely popular, it is inevitable that the two are compared.  To be honest, that probably accounts for the majority of the negative comments but here are what I feel are the pros and cons:

Pros:
~ The atmosphere of the game is every bit as good as the first.  While you are still within the city of Rapture, you explore different sections and I found accessing areas to be more straightforward with far less back tracking. For those that played the first one, it is true that some of the shine has worn off Rapture. The art work and details just aren't as interesting and exciting as the initial playthrough of Bioshock but overall, the game holds true to the atmosphere of the original and it still looks good.  While there was no noticable upgrade to the overall graphics, some of the enemies and moving parts look cleaner and more defined.  The PS3 version looks polished and complete and I saw no issues with clipping, etc.

~ The story line, while not nearly as intricate and detailed as the first game, still holds your interest throughout. Don't expect a lot of twists and turns and you won't be disappointed.

~ I really enjoyed playing as a Big Daddy. Its just more fun and more original.  Also, I felt that the Little Sisters were more engaging this time around and the developers did a good job of making you want to protect them.  You still have choices that will directly effect which ending you get and there are 4 total.

~ The mechanics and movement are essentially the same as the first game but thankfully, the peripheral vision has vastly improved.

~ You have both your plasmid and your weapon accessible simultaneously. The first game forced you to choose which was armed at any given time.

~ Hacking has changed.  In my opinion, this is the greatest improvement in the game. While some may find it too easy, I detested the pipe reorganization in the first one.  It just felt like it ripped you out of the game and it was tedious and annoying.  Now you just stop a needle in a colored portion of the dial and you are good to go.  You also get bonuses for stopping in the blue sections and its well worth your while to make the effort.  I also didn't have a problem with the remote hacking darts, which apparently caused some players problems.

~ The first game had your default melee weapon as a wrench, which I used frequently because there is nothing like getting up front and personal. This time around, you get a drill, which can use fuel to actually drill into things or you can just swing it and beat the crap out of someone. Its quite effective, especially as you progress through the game and get upgrades.  I used it more than any other weapon in the game.  Keep in mind that you can use any weapon as melee but there is just something about that big old drill.  Muhahahaha.

~ Controls are fine.  While some players complained that the controls weren't responsive and they couldn't pick up items, I didn't find this to be an issue at all.

~There are TONS of pick ups.  First aid kits, money, eve, ammo, etc.  In fact, if you spend a little time looking around, you often find more items than you can carry.  I really don't understand the complaints unless other reviewers are just plowing through the game without even looking.  There are also lots of plasmid upgrades and level up items around. Take a few seconds and search!

~ The Power to the People stations are in this game so you can upgrade your weapon of choice but the U-Vent machines are gone.  Personally, I didn't miss them or the requirement to search for 7 different parts to make one weapon or item to continue.  Finding those parts involved even more back tracking which bogged down the original game.

~There are plenty of Trophies for those perfectionists out there.

~The multiplayer games are surprisingly fun.  There are plenty of on-line players and it adds a different aspect to the game.  There is player customization and a ranking up feature that unlocks trials and weapon/plasmid upgrades.  You can play as part of a team or in a match where it's every man for himself.  One room allows you to play a capture the flag type game where the flag is a Little Sister.  While the gameplay does not change, each match occurs in different areas from the original Bioshock...ah, nostaglia.  You can easily get sucked into the on-line games and end up wasting hours there.  There are Trophies to be earned in the multiplayer games as well.

~ Like the original, during load screens you will get hints on gameplay.  They can be helpful for players that have run into problems and you can fast forward or reverse through them as needed.

 Cons:
~ Just like the first one, the initial load is PAINFULLY slow.  I mean, like 20 minutes long.  Come on, seriously.

~ The plasmids and weapons (except the drill) are also about the same.  There are a few upgrades here and there but nothing stellar, which is disappointing and really a missed opportunity.

~ The over-hyped ""explore outside Rapture"" is a joke.  You move along a very linear path for about 15 total minutes of game play.  There are Adam slugs to look for but no enemies or challenge so it is gimmicky at best.

~ While the overall story is fine, there are plot holes.  Dr. Tennebaum makes a reappearance but then suddenly she just disappears, never to be heard from again.  Also, for some reason the Big Sisters feel the need to attack you even if you rescued the Little Sisters.  Another issue is that despite the fact that you are a Big Daddy, the amount of damage you take is the same as if you were a puny human.  A few smacks from your averge Splicer and you're toast. As you level up your max health, the enemies get more difficult obviously so that aspect doesn't really change much.

~ The music is not as good or as original as the first.

~ Most of the enemies that you encounter are almost exactly like the original game.  They've added a few new ones like the Big Sisters but another missed opportunity.  There is also repetition with the Adam collection process and you'll see the same enemies with the same comments repeatedly.

All in all, Bioshock 2 is an exceptional game.  If it wasn't compared to the orignal, it would get rock solid reviews all around but as a sequel there were a few disappointments and missed opportunities.  Still, I found the game to be very engrossing and enjoyed every last minute of it.  It's one of those games that once you finish, you want to start all over.  Definitely fun and definitely worth the purchase!",I choose Rapture...Again,1272758400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This is a more realistic game of tennis than that of Wii Sports and Sega Superstars Tennis.  This game utilizes the Wii Remote to `swing', and the Nunchuck to position your player, aim the ball, and get ready to serve.  I found the game was more fun after going through the 2 pages of tutorials.  This is not necessarily a game that you can play right out of the box, unlike Wii Sports.  Unlike other games before it, it utilizes different physics from one court to the next and the players have different strengths.  Not one player is maxed out in statistics, like in games like Tiger Woods (although, in his case, it probably is more like reality but back to Tennis).

Graphics is mediocre but there is no screen flicker or slowdown.  There are replays and `screen action modes' to get a zoomed up view of your player; however, it does get old so clicking `B' gets you right back into the action.  You can also perform gestures to show your happiness or frustration with your player.  Music is actually good, and not repetitive.

Setup of your Wii remote involves holding it on its side, which is unconventional from the standard way to hold the remote, so it is awkward to start.  You can opt for Normal Serve or Easy Serve/Special shot with the Nunchuck.  What makes this game more realistic is the ability to aim your shot, make your player run to the baseline or net, hit Top Spins or Slice Shots.  You can also perform Drop shots and lob shots.

I find Singles play to be easy for me.  Conceptually, I cannot get into the rhythm of Doubles play, so I will pass.

4.0,False,"08 1, 2008",A2M7CLVA0KIHQF,B0010YOQJQ,J.S. Knapp,"I starting playing with Legos over 25 years ago.  I only started playing Xbox 1 year ago!  I played both LEGO Star Wars II: the Original Trilogy and LEGO Star Wars the Complete Saga - both to 100%.

These games are a lot of fun, and if you enjoyed playing Lego Star Wars you WILL enjoy playing LEGO Indiana Jones.  I am not an Indiana Jones fan - I can't remember seeing a SINGLE I.J. movie.  But I STILL enjoy these games because the play style is familiar and even at 29 years of ago, I LOVE LEGOS!

The game divides its story into three movies - Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, and Last Crusade.  Each movie is broken into 6 sub-sections which after completing players can continue to the next section or return to Barnett College which serves as a playable ""menu,"" allowing players to switch to a different movie, purchase characters or ""extras"" such as invincibility, etc.  Purchases use ingame currency, called ""Studs,"" represented by small, round lego blocks.

LEGO Characters in the game use various skills to proceed through the levels - piles of legs must be assembled into vehicles doorways, or bridges.  Characters can use shovels to dig up treasure chests or other blocks for a multitude of uses.  Indiana Jones can use his trusty whip to grab unreachable items, or swing from platform to platform.  The game is usually pretty clear about what needs to be done next - buried items ""sparkle,"" platforms that Indy can swing from are highlighted, and even crawlspaces and hieroglyphic boards are highlighted to stand out, easing the puzzle solving process.

The game does seem to be a bit more ""buggy"" than the Lego versions.  Characters swinging items or picking items up sometimes causes a weird ""blip"" on the screen where the game engine seems to forget the shape of the item, causing a very weird stretching glitch on the screen.  It's very brief, but weird nonetheless.  In the Star Wars versions, some sections would require on-screen characters to work in tandem to access rooms/platforms.  In these situations, the artificial intelligence would kick in, causing the non-player-controller character to perform the required duties.  In Indiana Jones, however, the game forces the player to set the first character in position, then press a button to assume control of the second character, performing its required duties.  What often seems to happen is, when control is switched from one character to the next, the AI takes over the first character, moving him/her out of position and requring the player to start all over again.  This isn't often, but happens just frequent enough to cause frustration and in some cases, required the same sequence to be performed several times before being succesful.

The new parcel retrieval puzzles, which allow the unlocking of things like invulnerability, multiplication of collected studs, etc, is a fun addition which requires new methods of problem solving not present in the Star Wars games.  More challenging still is the ability to move various structures that then make reaching artifacts or parcels impossible, causing you to replay the level more strategically.  This isn't a bad thing - it forces you to think a little harder.

Lastly, the bang for your buck is tremendous, as it was in all of the Star Wars games.  Reaching 100% completion in the game can require replaying each subsection of each movie 3 or more times to reach every artifact or parcel, or unlock every character.  Completing all three movies might only require 10 hours or so.  I've played for approximately 25 hours and am only 75% complete with the game.  Players unfamiliar with the LEGO game strategy may need more time to learn the tricks of the game designers.

The only downside is, once the game is completed to 100%, it's virtually worthless.  It'll take you a long time to get there, but there's little fun value after playing unless you're a die-hard Indiana Jones fan.  I chose to rent the game because I know I could reach 100% (and earn all the achievements) before the return date.

LEGO Indiana Jones does a few things worse than it's predecessors but has a few new tricks up it's sleeve.  It's a fun game that never gets too challenging or too frustrating and provides hours of clean, fun entertainment for all age ranges.

Why is it so ADDICTIVE? Simple. While playing, you constantly strive for the next achievement. ""I'm just gonna play until I activate the waypoint for the Dark Woods... Well, while I'm here I mine as well try and level my character up... If I can just get 1000 more pieces of gold, I can buy that nifty shield... You get the idea.
Blizzard has improved on many of the problems people had with the original Diablo. First off, they have improved the overworld so that it includes more than 1 town... It now has four, and each town is surrounded by MASSIVE amounts of places to explore. The dungeons are no longer piled on top of eachother. Instead, they are spread out over the huge land.
The inventory system has been improved, but is still a pain. You now have a chest in town that will hold some of your junk, thus doubling your inventory. However, the junk in there cannot be accessed while in battle. Therefore, pack as much junk as you can on your back.
Quests are now NOT random (thank God). What this means is that everyone gets the same quests. You still don't have to complete ALL of them, but trust me... you should.
What has Blizzard not improved? Well, for one thing, the gameplay is as repetitive as ever. Click Click Click Click Click Click... It never ends! You wade through monster after monster after monster after monster after monster... see how annoying it can be?

Franchise mode is still as good as the other maddens, great deepth and fun and addicting off season options to do. plus you can receive skill points for completing goals like get 5 TD's in the week's game. 1 skill point= 5 attribute points for a player of your choice's stats.

a very functional gameplay makes for exciting football action, this game is hard to put down i honestly like the psp version better than the PS3 because you can play it anywhere.

No pump fake, no throw away ball button, no Play Challenge is not cool. also a few glitches like sometimes at halftime when you're suppose to get the ball they do. sometimes you throw a ball the QB spins around the ball drops and it counts as in incomplete pass
also no create a player, however what i did is just used a generic rookie changed his name and used skill points to improve him.

If you're looking for an RPG, and can't stand childish gameplay look elsewhere. This isn't a typical Dragon Quest game.

However if you can get past the childishness there's a lot to love about Dragon Quest Rocket Slime.

This game really is more like 2 games in one. Half the time it's a God view action/adventure platformer where your goal is to progress through various areas of Slimenia defeating enemies and collecting items and enemies. The other half of the game is spent fighting tank battles, which is by far more in depth. You can customise your supporting characters which have different strengths and weeknesses, edit the ammo that your tank carries (ammo is extremely varied and can include almost any item you can pick up while progressing through the various worlds and be created by combining items in your alchemy pot. In addition to loading the two cannons with ammo you can also use your crew (and yourself) to infiltrate the enemy tank; steal items, attack the enemy crew and generally wreck havoc.

In short this is a fun, light hearted, and pretty easy game that will keep you entertained for a good 15-20 hours. I couldn't put it down and enjoyed the entire experience.

I heard of the concept and laughed so hard I fell down.  A Disney/Sqare Action-RPG mishmash?  No way.  Yet, last year, I found myself caught in the gaming drought of summer.  No new games that I wanted to play, no new releases for a couple months.  So.......I picked it up in the bargain rack, just to see how terrible it was.  From the first few notes of the haunting score, I was hooked.  The storyline of Sora and pals is of equal quality to the Final Fantasy series and pretty much every RPG ever.  The ""epicness"" of the plotline, mixed with a beautiful score, pretty decent voice acting (Haley Joel Osment, anyone?), innovative gameplay, and surprisingly challenging difficulty makes this one of the year's best releases.  I won't spoil the plotline for you, but it begins with a boy receiving a strange blade and a search for a lost king.

The most important part of any RPG (in my opinion), is the gameplay.  How hard is it?  Does the camera pose any problems?  As an action RPG, is there enough depth in the magic system?  Is there too much hack and slash?  Well, good news.  The game successfully answers many of these questions.  Sora and his trusty Keyblade will slice and dice through literally thousands of Heartless, yet the boss battles can be so hard you will be shaking your head at how you were mercilessly obliterated by a Disney character.  There is quite a lot of depth in the magic system and the Keyblade is customizable to your fighting style.  Yet, the game doesn't overcomplicate things.  However, the biggest foe is the camera, which seems hell-bent on messing up your sweet combos.  This is a huge disadvantage, especially in a few of the boss battles, which are hard enough.  For a game with all these great assets, I was surprised a renowned RPG powerhouse like Square didn't pay more attention to this serious flaw.

Bottom line: you'll have a great time with this action/RPG that appeals to all ages and difficulties.  It's tons of fun to play with and against Disney characters that you know and love.  It's an amazingly addictive game and I can't wait for the sequel.

I've been reading the comics since I was 5, own all of the movies, most of the old games, and even have a tatoo of the black suit spider on my arm. I've also played nearly all of the Spider-Man games from the Super Nintendo ones to the N64 Spider-Man to the movie games and Ultimate Spider-Man on the PS2.  It all comes down to the fact that no, it is not as good as Spider-Man 2 for the PS2 (probably one of my favorite games, and definately the best of the Spider-Man bunch), but it's also awesome in it's own regard.

For one thing, this is the first game since the PSX/N64 ones to be based on the normal Marvel Universe Spidey.  As such you control Spidey in a New York that's populated with the comic versions of Wolverine, Luke Cage, and Mary Jane.  And you also see some of the sights like Wilson Fisk's building and Stark Tower.  Just being able to be in this universe will definetely delight any fan who's followed the comics in any fashion over the past 10-15 years.  But it also doesn't explain when in time it is.  The story doesn't mention wether the Civil War or Secret Invasion has taken place, whether Peter's identity is out in the open, or what the status of MJ and Pete's relationship is.  It's just kind of...there.

The controls however, are amazing as usual.  I love it because the web-swinging is spot on. The combat I admit can get repetitive, but it still looks exactly like stuff the Spider-Man would do in the comics. A lot of people probably get bored with the web attacks where you zip back to some dude and kick him in the chest or throw him into a wall. I can't get enough of it.  Some of the controls might seem a little off at first just because some of the normal things like clinging to a wall or web-zipping are in different places, but you'll catch on through some of the tutorials.

I'll be the first to admit the storyline isn't the best thing I've seen, and the voice acting kind of makes you cringe. But the actual Dialogue is great. I have no idea where they got the whiny little voice that plays Spidey, but it's still funny when he starts cracking jokes and firing off those one-liners that he's famous for. It's one of those games that's almost better while listening to a cd with the tv on mute while reading the dialogue between characters.

So if you're just looking for a game or something to dethrone Spider-Man 2, you're probably better off looking elsewhere. But if you like the character and have had fun with the previous games. You'll really get a kick out if it.",Comic fans rejoice!,1224979200,16,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

I have never seen a game where so much effort and money have gone into making every screen glow, every move worked out to complete precision. It's said that the game cost $100,000,000 to develop. Lead designer Ken Levine has been working on it for six years. That's a lot of resources invested in it.

Another thing is that the game has great emotional depth. This is an area where Levine's two Bioshock games have really shone. They don't so much have a story line as a complete mythology. They are emotionally captivating, resonant.

The game is like a nightmare. The progress of the game doesn't really make much sense, other than that the player is deeply involved in trashing the city in the sky. Portraits of George Washington and Abe Lincoln keep appearing in one form or another, as paintings, on the faces of lunatic automatons, and so forth. Levine has said that the subtext of the game is American exceptionalism. I can see that. Does one ENJOY immersion in a nightmare about American exceptionalism? I didn't, entirely. It's unforgettable though.

For all the vast resources invested in the game, it's rather quickly finished. I'm almost, but not quite, finished.

Don't get me wrong, there are things I would like to have seen improved on, but they're minor. For instance, I'd like more variety in the geography and mission styles, and I'd love to be able to worry less about what armor I'm wearing because within 1-2 missions it's no longer the hottest item on the market. It would be nice to customize the armor of your companions and some added dimension to the custom options would have been nice. The biggest issue is probably the severe linearity of the plot. You've got essentially 3 ways you can respond to anything that it said to you in the game: nice, sarcastic, and blunt. Regardless of the tone you take, the outcome is basically the same. I wanted more plot shifts based on player choices/responses, more consequences for the decisions being made, and more complexity to the entire experience.

Great graphical power: Even powerful that Xbvo360 or PS3, my neighbor had and Xbox360 and he was impressed with the Wii U graphical power, the reason why some people say that the graphical quality between Wii U, PS3 and Xbox360 is about the same is because the human eye had limits to notice the differences, you need a 72'' TV to notice the difference between each console graphics, in fact I don't really matter to me the graphical issue I prefer the console be fun thats why I has a Wii and not a PS3 or Xbox360, the way to paly in a Wii is so much fun and interactive that in PS3 or Xbox360 and if you prefer you can switch to a classic control scheme for the mostly of games.

The new Control PAD: The all new way to play, this is the true reason why I prefer the Nintendo's console game, always had something to innovate some new that other console don't had and always try to emulate (like PS move and xbox Kinetic try to emulate the Wii control scheme), the new pad make the game more fun and challenger it is not just to switch from the TV to the pad's screen to play, is about to use both the TV and the Pad while you play, I was afraid for the new pad and lose the interactive level of each game present in the Wii, but the game are always had some interactive like in Wii

In My opinion nintendo Wii U the 8th generation console published by nintendo is just the big brother of the Wii with it nintendo attend to recover the market that lost win Nintendo Wii because Nintendo Wii has less graphical power that the other 7th generation console and the most of games published for nintendo Wii are rated for Everyone with a lot of tittles for kids and families, the game for Wii rated T or M+17 o just M are some rare compared with the rated E (but exist like monster Hunter 3, RE Dark Side Chronicles, COD MW3) and a lot of tittles that never was published to Wii. with the new Wii U with with more powerfull graphics that PS3 or Xbox360 are a lot of titles launched to Wii U that never would be launched for nintendo, like Assisant Cred, Ninja Gaiden 3, well there are not very much violent games for Wii but there a lot for Wii U and more are incoming, well I had 30 years old and personally I prefer the games rater E and M that the games rater T, the E rater games are more fun, can be played with family and friends and the rater M (mostly of time are a violent one too) used to have a better story just like the mostly of RPG.

But the title of this review is: I Don't Recommended for Kids - To much violent and need to much console's care.
I'm not against the violence in video games I really like some violent games but for me the violence level in a video game is good for teens around 17 years old and for adult people but not for a Kid (and some games exceeded the level of violence and irreverence in my opinion -like GOW for Sony's consoles- ),  but this is not the case because a lot of kids play games too much violent rater T or M, the reason why I don't recommended the Wii U for Kids is ... The control Pad ... well it just like a tablet had a touch LCD screen it need and extra care when you are playing, for example how much time you or a some while are playing are drop off the control ? for and accident, or because got angry to lose the game... well try to do it with the new Pad on the Wii U ... the control pad could resist the impact, but the LCS screen ??? and it is not just the control pad, it is about the safety of a Kid, if the LCS screen get broke ? it is not just glass it is had plastic but this little broke pieces can hurt to someone ... it is not a good idea give it to a 12 or 8 years old kid right?. Ok you can play Wii games on the wii U, using the Wii motes or Wii motes plus so is a kid drop off the control is not a big issue I had 30 years old and I accidentally drop it some times because the game are very interactive and need to be move just like some games on the Wii U.

With DEAD SPACE 3 the developers have adhered to the prevalent belief that more must be better and have expanded on most aspects of the game. The results are mixed but the game still packs a pretty impressive survival horror punch. DS3 continues to do what the previous two games did so well: it delivers a tense, claustrophobic experience with challenging, close-quarter combat and plenty of startling moments. The story is reasonable although perhaps not quite as convincing as the first two instalments. There are also a greater variety of environments this time, including the surface of an inhospitable frozen planet. The graphics are good, although I cant say I noticed any real improvement on DS2 in this area. One of the most notable changes is the greatly expanded weapon construction/upgrade system, which allows you to create and customise your own weapons. The system works well but I found myself hankering for the simpler weapons of the two earlier games as they gave credence to the fact that Isaac is an engineer using basic tools to fight the necromorphs. The suits available can still be upgraded but theres no dramatic change in this system over the previous games. Sadly Visceral decided to abandon the manual save stations used in 1 and 2 and have opted for a typical checkpoint system instead. Bad news for us PC gamers but par for the course these day.

You keep gaining new powers as the levels progress to keep things interesting, but there just isn't enough to make it more entertaining. Biggest compaint I have is that the environments all look the same and aren't too interactive, e.g., you have these powerful weapons but cannot destroy cardboard boxes.  A better mix of levels would have helped tremendously.  More weapons would have been great too, but you can't accumulate enough money to buy more than 2-3 guns.  And all the enemies look pretty much the same and the puzzles get old quick.  There are a couple of good boss battles that I'd replay, but that's it.  I'd change my rating to 3.5 stars.  A definite rental, but then again, it is priced correctly now so you could add to your library and not feel ripped off.

I'm halfway through the game and here are my impressions:

For $20, this is not a bad game to pick up.  It plays a lot like Gears but less refined.  The graphics are pretty good; the only thing is that the environments and levels are pretty blase--hopefully they get better as most of the levels look very similar.  The controls aren't too bad, only thing is that melee stinks and sometimes when you want to go into cover you wind up diving instead, but I had the same problem with Gears at times.  Nothing more to add about the glaive or the guns as that's been covered by others.

This game is really under-rated due to it's lack of creativity and being a copycat of other games.  That's fine--so give it a 1 for creativity; but that doesn't affect the fun you'd have playing it.  If you like slicing and dicing people and don't mind the 3rd person shooter too much, then this is a great pickup at the price.",Decent game,1215388800,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},
4.0,False,"02 21, 2013",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B007BUA0AM,Lisa Shea,"""Wargame: European Escalation"" is a relatively solid real-time-tactics game with some minor issues.

Set in a ""Cold War gone hot"" scenario, Wargame: European Escalation casts you as either a NATO or Warsaw Pact commander in several different scenarios (as well as skirmish matches and multiplayer). The player commands groups of tanks, helicopters, infantry and so on to capture key points, hold objectives, and defeat the enemy. The game's scale is relatively large and ""zoomed out"", so it's possible to be ordering around over a hundred units at a time (though they're at least grouped into platoons for relatively easy ordering). The game's camera can be zoomed in far enough to see individual tanks in relatively good detail, or it can be zoomed out far enough to see the entire battlefield.

The game has a lot of detail in some areas and not quite enough in others. Every unit has limited ammunition and fuel that must be replenished either by moving the unit to a stockpile or having a truck or helicopter bring supplies to the unit. Units engage at realistically long ranges and require line of sight to do so (except for artillery). Forests and urban areas can provide concealment for units. However, in certain areas the game is frustratingly simplistic. The maps are all relatively flat, and while there ARE hills and curves in the terrain that affect line of sight, they're difficult to spot from anything but the closest possible range. It's not really possible to affect how units are directed or pointed once they're in position, despite the fact that tanks and other vehicles have different levels of armor on different sides. Infantry especially seem limited, with no options to dig in or take advantage of any cover that vehicles can't already do.

The game's graphics are relatively nice, at least considering the scale being worked with. They're not amazing, but they're functional, and there's a lot of different units from the Cold War era. The game's unlock system is a little frustrating - playing through missions earns you ""command stars"", which are then used to unlock new units. It's not possible to jump into a skirmish game and use whatever units you want, you have to unlock them by playing the regular game first. This isn't necessarily a huge deal mechanically (since you can unlock the basic unit classes pretty quickly and a lot of the units are similar) but it's frustrating from a design standpoint.

Overall, Wargame: European Escalation is a decent game, but not anything special. It's certainly functional aside from a few issues, but the relatively low detail may turn off those looking for an in-depth experience, and the scale may annoy those looking for a more casual one. Not really worth going out of your way for.

Rating: 7/10.

Should I get the newest incarnation of NBA Live with all it's promises of better gameplay than the year before or should I stick with the reliable, yet bland 2k series?  Well this year, I actually find myself playing NBA Live 08 more than I do NBA 2k8.  That's not a knock to 2k8, but I find Live 08 to be a more straight-forward basketball experience.  There are no crazy gimmicks that detract from the gameplay.

So what's new this year?  Everything.  The game has been completely rebuilt from the ground up with gameplay being the biggest improvement.  Low post players can now dominate the paint with a variety of offensive moves (spins, hook shots, pump fakes, etc.)  Cross-overs and juke moves using the right thumbstick are more fluid and realistic and new signature moves are also a nice addition.  For instance, while holding the right trigger and pushing either the dunk or shoot button, your superstar will pull off a power move only unique to him that increases the chances of having the shot go in.  There's even a nice video tutorial during the shoot around session at the main menu which shows each superstar's primary signature move.

The graphics have been given a complete overhaul and surprisingly, I found that the player models in Live 08 were much better than the ones in 2k8.  Facial modeling is superb and dead on.  EA really went out of their way to create eaThe courts look accurate and are cleanly rendered.  The crowds are also very nice and don't resemble spray-painted card board boxes as they do in other sports titles.

Despite the vast improvement in this year's game as opposed to the year before, there are still a couple of glaring problems that are downright maddening.  The worst is the ridiculous loading times before a game.  I once clocked it at four minutes.  Online games are not much better.

The A.I. substitutions can also be a little loopy as point guards will occasionally be substituted for centers.  Point blank shots near the rim tend to clang off the metal and there are instances where a player with the ball will be standing clearly out of bounds and nothing is called.

Despite these bugs, I still enjoy playing Live 08.  It's not much better than 2k8, but I appreciate the fluidity of the controls and the excellent visuals and player models.  Good job, EA.","Great game, but not quite a slam dunk!",1192665600,5,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

However, I noticed a lot of these reviews are simply aimed at the fact the game is Vista-only. (despite being titled Games for Windows.) Since I currently run Vista, I don't really care that XP users can't run the game. Quite frankly, it bothered me that so many negative reviews weren't about the game, but simply that MSFT decided to make it Vista.

Getting past this, I installed the game on my system and it runs beautifully. My computer is heavy on the performance side, so I'm not sure how well it runs on older systems. (I assume most Vista-installed machines have decent specifications.) I also own an Xbox360, so it's great to easily load up my Xbox Live account and play with all my friends. The game matching takes a minute or two, but there are always games available, even late at night.

The gameplay is enjoyable. Note: There is no campaign or anything like that. The only single player aspect of this game is the training. You can pick up how to play the game fairly quickly, but it will take some time to really master the skills and use them competitively.

It's got a CS feel to it (since you buy your equipment/magic at the start of every game) but the magic adds an interesting level of strategy to the game. Since people can fairly easily be resurrected in the game, mowing down an enemy and moving on isn't always the best strategy.

Overall, this game is an enjoyable FPS. As I said earlier, the learning curve is slight to play but large to really get good. I recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have any gripes about it being Vista only.",Great fun,1185926400,25,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Graphics-wise, it's the best game of this type I've seen or played - in terms of the puzzles, the comic book style introduction to each chapter, and the full-blown animation present at the beginning and end of the game as a whole.  Basically, you're helping a young couple - and the strange little ghost hunter who mysteriously turns up at their door - to find and trap the myriad of ghosts haunting their home.  Among all of the hidden objects you have to find across 30 unique rooms are the components the weird ghost hunter will use to trap the main spirits haunting each section.  You are also called upon to discover a number of lesser (and much more comical) spirits along the way.  The music and ambient sounds actually add to the experience, especially the dark ghostly chuckle you hear when you've found objects that will be used to trap a particular ghost.  Mishap also comes with as diverse a set of mini-games as you're likely to find in a game such as this - some are more enjoyable and challenging than others, but they are all optional for the player.  The game also comes with some extra features to make the whole experience a little more amusing - for every one of the pesky ghosts you're trapping, there's a funny story behind his/her demise.  Heck, the storyline of the game even throws in a surprise twist at the very end.

I must admit, however, that I experienced some annoying technical problems that had a definite negative impact on my game experience.  After I completed the first two chapters, I was forced to endure a horrible and constant roar coming out of my speakers.  I could still make out the words and music on top of the sound, but it was a really annoying problem.  Sometimes it would clear itself up for a chapter ending or maybe even an entire chapter, but it always came back with a vengeance at some point.  I could find no problem with my sound settings, and reinstalling the game accomplished nothing in this regard.

I believe it to rank with Star Wars in terms of story, characters etc. This game, story wise, really kept me playing. I thought I was only going to be sitting with the campaing for maybe an hour and then moving onto the multiplayer/skirmish modes. Not the case.

I've taken a break to leave a review. I've sunk about 15 hours into the campaing mode and still have not beaten the game. This is a true Halo ""I've got to finish the game!"" kind of game. If you enjoyed the other three FPS games you can stop reading now - same to be said if you rolled your eyes at the idea of another Halo game.

This game lives up to the high standard the Halo franchise is held to. The graphics are great in 1080p, the voice acting is on par with the rest of the series, and the cut scenes that drive the story make you wonder: ""Now why haven't they just made a CG movie yet?""

Every RTS that hits a console has always had the trouble of ease of use when it comes to controls. This is a pick up and play kind of game. The controls are deep enough that any PC can appreciate the effort made.

Unit upgrades and options are clear and to the point. You can swiftly see why you need to updgrade your tech, supplies, units etc in order to run a blitzkreig on your enemy.

I would expound further on a few things but that would be a spoiler in my eyes. Check the video review at IGN, you'll see gamplay, graphics etc. Don't rely solely on Amazon user reviews to justify a purchase. This is targeted at Halo fans, if you're not one then you may not like it for that shallow reasoning alone.

I give this a 4/5 stars only because of unit limitations. You can only create an army so big, and it's marginal when considering such PC games like the Command and Conquer series. I was also hoping for a wider array of air units and the inclusion of sea-based units. While sea based units are not included in the books etc the developers could have made a believable reach by creating them.

As I bashed my way through Covenants forces on the Pillar Of Autumn I remembered just how frickin' great Halo Combat Evolved was. Thank you 343 for giving this kid flashbacks of great times.  The developers did a great job re-creating all ten levels in new Xbox 360 graphics. For those who speculate the graphics are lack-lackluster go ahead and flip the settings to classic mode...good, now disable them. Ah, now you see just how great 343 did. This is fantastic for gamers who do not want to play old Xbox games, now you will only have to play Halo 2, but want to play through the Halo series start to finish.

I was severely disappointed there was no Halo:CE multiplayer re-created. Just some maps you can access in Reach.  That sucks. I recommend just renting this game because you can only play the campaign, and most people can burn through that in just days.  Still there is great fun and memories to be had.

Personally, the adding of the terminals was great. I loved finding the terminals and looking at the extra content. The terminal on ""Keyes"" was so revealing and kinda freaky, but a plus never the less.

The way 343 handled Halo: CEA is promising for the newest Halo trilogy. Cheers to them!

After a while, you'll know exactly what will happen in a situation. Do this, Nazi riflemen will appear at point A, do that, Nazi sailor runs to man a machinegun. Use the sniper rifle to deal with rooftop snipers, use the Tommy gun to waste the three Nazis behind this door. Don't follow the script, don't win. A little more flexibility would have been nice. A slightly oversensitive targeting cursor and disappearing bodies also detract from the game.
That said, it's still a great experience first time around. The opening D-Day mission is excellent. Nearby explosions will shake your targeting, men will yell out for help and orders. The PS2 *does* have limitations, so don't expect a full out Saving Private Ryan. Still, the first time you see an American soldier disappear in the middle of an artillery shell explosion or a jeep losing control after getting strafed by an enemy fighter you'll probably wince or go, ""Glad that wasn't me"", much like a movie. After repeated viewings, though, it just kinda loses its impact as you go through the motions of the script.
The music is especially good, really giving the game that flavor of an epic WW2 movie. Just listening to it is enough to get me pumped to get through a mission. Even the title screen is set up to evoke those times, with old fashioned radios with clicky knobs and switches. I swear, this could have been the menu screen for a DVD, which further makes me believe that this is more like being in a movie of WW2 than actually being in WW2.

Once Sega began spreading its talents to other consoles, CT was one of the first games to be exported, to both PlayStation 2 and GameCube ... but not XBox.  Instead, Sega and Hitmaker have brought an all-new version of the game exclusively to Microsoft's big black console.  It retains everything that made the original (and its DC-only sequel Crazy Taxi 2) great, while bringing with it new features and, unfortunately, a couple of new flaws.
If you've been living incommunicado lately (say, the last 2 1/2 years), the game casts you as a taxi driver in a big city, in this case Glitter Oasis (an homage to Las Vegas).  You get to choose one of four personas, each with uniquely-styled cabs (the choice of cabbie doesn't really affect gameplay enough, so just choose one you like).  Your job is to pick up passengers and transport them to their destinations within a certain time, using any means necessary.
Potential fares are highlighted by a colored dollar sign over a similarly-colored pick-up zone.  Red symbols denote short-distance (i.e., cheap) fares, with yellow, green and blue symbols pointing the way to more challenging (and more rewarding) fares.  An arrow at the top of the screen directs you towards your destination, a large highlighted area where you stop and drop-off your passenger.
If you make things ""interesting"" along the way, by executing high-speed drifts, near misses or gravity-defying jumps, your passenger will tip you more and more.  Succeed, and you get the fare plus the tips, along with bonus time to pick up other riders ... fail, and the passenger stiffs you and hops out of the cab, even if the destination is in sight.
Fans who missed out on CT 2 will notice a new feature ... the ability to pick up multiple passengers.  These riders are highlighted by a number instead of a dollar sign.  The stakes get really high here, since (a) your travel time--and potential fare--is much higher and (b) tips are multiplied by the number of passengers you have.  However, this is an all-or-nothing proposition ... if even one of the group doesn't make their destination in time, you lose the *ENTIRE* fare.
CT 3 is one of the most replay-loaded games released in a long time.  Crazy X brings you several new mini-games to play and unlock, along with a chance to improve your skills.  Best of all, you get West Coast and Small Apple, the arcade maps (modeled after San Francisco and New York, respectively) from both Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2, along with their own unique cabbies!
As cool as all this sounds, it's not without its flaws, minor as they are.  The game can be slow-loading at times, although it is faster than the demo disc some of you may have seen.  While graphically gorgeous, it's not significantly better than even the Dreamcast versions of CT and CT 2.  In fact, there are points of some limited slowdown; however, the screen has to be quite busy for this to occur, and when it does occur it isn't for very long (a couple of seconds).
The in-game music is appropriately fast-paced and very hard-rock oriented, from arists like The Offspring, Bad Religion and Tommy Lee.  It retains tracks from both previous games, and even re-uses sound samples.  Hardly original, but it don't take that much away from the game.  (Parents please note: Some of the music tracks have some brief adult language, hence the game's T rating.)
If you're a fan of CT and CT 2, you really can't go wrong with CT 3, especially since you get to re-live those games once again.  If this will be your first foray into the world of Crazy Taxi, rest assured that the positives of the game far outweigh the negatives.

Even without the creeping kids, there are still a ton of older folk who enjoy playing video games on my GameCube. So, the Wavebird would seem like the perfect choice; a controller that wouldn't have all the long wires draped across the floor (no kids could crawl and drag the system over he edge) that could still control the objects onscreen with perfect accuracy. Not quite.
Although the Wavebird looks and feels like a normal GameCube controller, you'd be mistaken to believe that's what it really is. You pick up the Wavebird, turn on the GameCube and sit down on the couch across the room. You start playing Smash Brothers, but you notice something missing. You realize that it's the rumble. You figure that it's no biggy, and continue playing happily. Once you're done with that, you put in Mario Sunshine. You're hovering over a gap between platforms, when suddenly, inexplicably, the hover jets kick out. You know that the water hasn't run out, so you assume that it's just you let up pressure on the trigger. Same thing happens again, this time on a different gap. You know you didn't let up pressure, and you know you didn't run out of water. What's the problem? The Wavebird, of course.
You see, the Wavebird, unlike other wireless controllers, operates on a radio signal. It happens to be a fairly strong signal, but not strong enough to bypass other electrical interference floating around in your house. The result is that sometimes the GameCube just does not pick up the signal. That's why your hover jets kicked out for no apparent reasons. However, such occurences are very uncommon, and don't really affect your play that much.
The Wavebird really is one of the best controllers out there, second only to the DualShock 2 and the standard GameCube controller. This could have been the best, but the occasional radio interference and lack of a rumble feature held it back. Regardless, the Wavebird is as good a choice as any for when you need a new GameCube controller.

This game introduced the idea of multiple abilities for Mario, and took the successful Mario Bros. 1 formula and extended it to more varied worlds.
I spent innumerable hours playing the original SMB3, and I poured an equal amount of time into it on the SNES in the form of Mario All Stars. Now here we are again with SMB3 on the Game Boy Advance. Is it still fun? You bet! The game has been left largely unchanged except for graphical and audio upgrades, and the addition of a save game function - definitely a welcome feature, given the length and difficulty of the game.
The GBA version has a few additions up its sleeve, namely the ability to scan items and levels in using the e-Reader add-on. You can read in items from Super Mario World (like the cape), levels from other Mario games, and other cool stuff. The only drawback here is that you need two GBA systems and a link cable, since there's no way to have the SMB3 cartridge inserted while also using the e-Reader. Definitely not a convenient feature, but a cool one nonetheless if you have the tools to do it. And the stuff you scan in is saved to the cartridge for later use.
This fourth Mario Advance game also includes the now-tired rendition of the original Mario Bros. arcade game. Lord knows why Nintendo feels this is worth including with every game - a little variety would be nice! It's there if you want it, but it's nothing to write home about.
Anyway, the final word on Super Mario Advance 4 is this: Mario Bros. 3 is still a blast to play, and I believe it deserves a place in the collections of both Mario newbies and veteran Nintendophiles alike.

This gets super meta really fast because it has characters from Paper Mario, who are based on the Mario Brothers in a Mario & Luigi RPG game that is a RPG style game with characters from the Mario Brothers world...

Sadly, because they add more Mario characters to a game about Mario characters, this is the most generic Mario RPG ever... You're traveling through generic Mario style worlds while meeting generic Mario style characters. Bowser's here and he's trying to build a INTERDEMINSIONAL BOMB! Just kidding, he's kidnapping again... So the story isn't the best, and the settings aren't amazing. Usually we get at least one or the other (story or setting) and often we get both with the Mario & Luigi RPGs--it's a disappointment to get neither... You get some comic relief usually from the paper counterparts interacting with the 3d counterparts. It's not a total waste, but it's disappointing. I guess it could pick up further than where I'm at, but we'll see.

But, the gameplay is very good. It's a turn based RPG with attacks and dodges that require timing based button presses. This keeps the battles very interactive without becoming a full action RPG. The battles have a lot of variety and always seems to be throwing something new in the mix. There's a lot of creativity with how the paper characters and the 3d characters interact and I think the papercraft ""tank"" battles at least mix things up. I still really like the challenging rhythm/timing gameplay in the battles, but there is an easy mode which I think my son will appreciate.

It's weird that with RPGs I often tire of the battle system by halfway through the game and then it's the story that keeps me going. Here I think I'm going to tire of the story but I think the fighting will stay interesting. So it's a good but not great game.

So what do I not like about the game?  Well, after playing for an hour or so, the game kind of starts to get old.

I did say everything is bright and shiny.  But, if you get close to something and really look at it, there really is no depth.  No texture.  No shading, just a bland color.  That was a real let down.  From a game that I have heard, over and over, looks so great.

This game is very fast paced.  You hardly ever sit still.  It is intense, but it kind of gets annoying.  I just want to run around and stop when I choose, but, the only way to really survive while killing the bad guy is to move, non-stop.  My mind has to spend far to much time trying to figure out where the hell I am going to jump to next to really pay attention to anything on the ground.  The two counter act each other.  If that were not annoying enough, some of the time, there is a guy talking to you, telling you about new things that are happening.  Ive no clue what the guy has said to me at any point thus far.

So, I sit here wondering what I should do.  Do I give the game, which in some ways, is fun.  Easy to control and hear.

Graphics manages to deliver perfectly, and are close to photorealistic. Same with audio. There's NPC conversations everywhere, and I've yet to hear one duplicated. And theres two entire city models, between the 1940's and 1950's, which means almost two entire sets of models and backgrounds, though this is a complaint later. Voices are spot on, and accents are authentic without being thick enough to be difficult to understand.

Gameplay is a touch merciless. Its possible to be killed by an out of sight enemy before you're aware of their presence, but otherwise, cover to cover combat works well. Cover is present without degrading from the quality of the background: you'd actually expect the materials to be there, and to actually stop bullets. Otherwise, everything is laid out how you'd expect it. Supply shops sprinkled lightly through a 3 region world map. Game mechanics to steal cars quietly or loudly.

What kills this for me is how cripplingly short it is. I'd expected GTA: WW2 Mafia. They even had it broken up well, with 3 families controlling 3 different regions of New York. But instead, this is a whopping 12 story missions. They may be hour long, well put together story missions, but that manages to make this a 11-12 hour game.

[Civ 6 Vanilla Review]:  tl:dr -- If you are new the 4x genre, Civ 6 is a great starting point; it's colorful, well designed and polished, and has multiple difficulty levels to help you grow as a player.  If you are a veteran, there is no reason for you to shy away from this.  It adds new city planning mechanics and non-combat strategies, and while at the end of the day you personally might decide you enjoy other games better, Civ 6 delivers a phenomenal package that can be enjoyed for many, many, MANY hours.  Well worth the purchase.

If I had to summarize the biggest change between 5 and 6, I would say that Civilization 6 is a breath of fresh air in city construction side of the 4X genre.  Much as Civ 5 revamped the combat system by creating the one unit per hex rule, Civ 6 requires you to invest in land in order to expand your city.  No longer can you somehow dominate the world from a single hex.  Now, you are forced to create districts in the outlying to gain the use (and thus benefit) of various buildings.  You want that library?  You're going to need a campus.  Want to make your people happier?  You'll need an entertainment complex.  These and 10 other districts must be placed in the hexes surrounding your city, leading to significantly more interesting debates about land usage.

This debate extends to wonders as well.  Wonders require not only space, but often terrain as well.  You'll need a desert hex for the pyramids, a flat hex next to your city center for the Eifel Tower, and some hills for your Oracle.  This leads to an excellent push and pull in not only your intra-city management, but inter-city as well.  Now, if you want to go down the wonder road, you need to plan to have multiple cities with the capability to support the large variety of wonders available to you.

The second big change is Culture Tree.  Much as the Tech Tree allows you to create better units and bigger industry, the Culture Tree drives your religion, interaction with city-states, and your governmental bonuses.  Honestly, it's not all that abrupt of a change given the 4X staple that is the tech tree, and it is a nice way to bring immersion.  No longer will you sit there going ""yep, my scientists discovered communism!""

The two last big changes are the re-inclusion of religion and its related victory, and the alteration of the of the culture victory.  Religions are now founded as soon as you get a prophet (if you grab them before everyone else!) and can be spread to different cities by your missionaries.  After your religion is the dominant religion in all civilizations, you claim victory!  ...  It's a bit of a crude system and doesn't offer many bonuses outside of the religious victory, but it is a nice to have another option to win outside of the standard tech/conquer/culture system.  Culture has gotten a revitalization as well.  Now, your win is dependent on not just your culture but your ability to attract people to your lands in the form of tourism.  The mechanics are too complex for a simple review like this, but the bigger point is that you might be engaged in a late game culture war that depends entirely on you being able to get the people of Greece to come and check out the Statue of Liberty.  The added tension is a big plus for an otherwise passive win mechanic.

There are a number other changes as well, of course, most notably the ""expendable builder"" mechanic.  Personally, I don't mind it; other's hate it.  Beyond there, there are tweaks to units, the nuances of government buffs, and a slew of new great people.  Fortunately, they all work well, with no one thing standing out as either horrible or game dominating.

I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a foray in the complex world of 4X strategy, and particularly to those who are looking for a game that can be won not only with troops but science, culture and religion as well.  It's a great way to pass quiet evenings.

[Digital Deluxe Review]:  The digital deluxe edition of Civ 6 has been a bit lackluster to date (as of 4/18/2017).  There has been a few new civilizations that are interesting enough, some different wonders, and that's about it.  I am hoping there is a bigger expansion coming that will offer some drastic game alterations, but reading the fine print it looks like those will probably be a la carte.

I don't care what you say, the PS2 is the best-feeling controller ever, and PS3 and PS4 are only good controllers because they're almost exactly like the PS2 controller. That being said this controller feels exactly like a PS2 controller! Only it's wireless. The color scheme lets me know which one is plugged into which. The buttons feel exactly like the buttons on an authentic PS2 controller, including how hard you press the buttons to make it work, the rubbery feel to the middle buttons, the texture of the analog sticks, and the oily texture of an ""experienced"" controller's analog stick. The analog button works the same way; you can turn it on or off. If you plug it into a computer, it needs to be ON.
Now for some details, many of them good:
 - This controller works both as a PS2 controller in a PS2, AND on a PC with a USB-dongle. As long as you got a good dongle, this controller will feel just like an authentic one. The controller does NOT replicate pressure-sensitivity. But nobody uses the assault rifle in Metal Gear Solid anyway.
 - This controller uses two AAA batteries. It doesn't seem to eat them fast, nor slow; about medium. Besides, in the far future we'll have batteries that recharge themselves wirelessly, for endless playing.
 - The very bottom of the controller has an on/off switch to save power, but the controller STILL has an auto-shut-off feature if it's too idle to save power.
 - There are two lights on both the dongle and the controller to signify if it's on, and if analog is turned on, and if the receiver picks up the controller. Seems to work from anywhere in my formerly 10x10 room with no lag.
 - The only issue I had with this controller is that the Square button has to be pressed a little harder to work. It's not even that bad, but in the heat of the game you may not hit that button right when you want, which really matters. I can live with it. Could just be my own personal unit.
 - Plus I like the new button markings. Kinda cool-lookin.
 - Also I don't know a thing about the rumble. The bearings seem to be in it, so I take it it works?","Almost perfect, more than worth the price they're asking!",1498003200,4,{'Color:': ' Blue'},

The game is good...not great, the song selection could've been way better with more of the #1's of THE BEATLES and it would've make it a much funnier game.
The hardware:
1. DRUMS:They look a lot like the RB2 drums but the bass pedal has a beatles logo as well as a drawing and aqua color. It has the possibility of being upgraded with the 3 cymbals and has an extra jack for later use. They have little black dots in the middle of each pad which mark the most sensitive part of the pad. The setting up is a bit confusing but after a few tries you'll get it.
2. BASS/GUITAR:The design is beautiful with the burned finish and the great shape the hofner bass has. It's dead easy to put together. Mine had an orange thing was a little lose but it still plays just fine.
3. MIC AND STAND:The mic doesnt change from the other RB mics, its wired and the stand is great but it's a little small for a person to be playin the guitar or bass and singing at the same time.
ps:DRUMS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH GUITAR HERO 5 AND 4,SMASH HITS AND METALLICA(havent tested it with 6)

OVERALL: The pack is great and you'll prefer it more for the instruments than for the game itself but afterall we all like at least one beatles song.:)

I wouldn't have even really noticed it except that it showed itself about half way through the game, right after you leave New York. it only showed itself for one chapter and then it was gone but it lasted just long enough for me to never enjoy combat as much as I did before. What was the flaw you ask? It doesn't work in close quarters combat. When you have 3 mechs pounding away at you on a narrow cliff and you can't get away then the game stops being fun. I died so many times in this one spot that I gave up and tried again later. This only happens in that ONE CHAPTER but it was enough to slightly stain the combat for the rest of the game though. Combat in general though is fun if not simplistic however this makes it easier to enjoy the other parts of the game and not think about the combat all the time.

I liked the platforming but is was also a bit simplistic. Think Uncharted and not Prince of Persia. It's incredibly easy and I never had trouble with it. It got a little more involved in the last two chapters but for the most part you don't have many timed jumps to deal with.

The rest of the game is perfect. The story, graphics, voice acting and everything else is just top notch. There are chase scenes both chasing and being chased which i thought was cool. no quick time events THANK GOD! Fun boss battles and not too many of them, just enough the satisfy. I loved the cloud(think hoverboard from Jak2) sections, they really showed off the beautiful environments. The ending was great, I won't spoil it for you but it's not at all what I expected and it was trippy as hell!

TIP to avoid this unpleasant experience I had...
Level up your stun blast so that it affects multiple enemies' as soon as possible. This made the problem much more manageable.

So in conclusion I think for the price you can't beat it it not only plays the original carts but some clones NES, SNES, Genesis. I almost forgot region free plays Pal NJ & PE not sure what that is but it will work also of course NTSC. Lastly I do not want anyone to think this is a knock on the Retron 5 I also love that system HDMI who can hate that.

As a shooter it's a mediocre game, and there are a lot of better titles out there.  As an overall game though, it's a fun title.  The graphics and controls can be a bit clunky, but are still good.  The AI is usually decent, but sometimes will have a complete meltdown which can be frustrating or disappointing.  The story progression and the characters are excellent.  What makes this game is the choices you can make and the results of those actions.  Do you try to do X, or save person Y, or try to figure out alternative Z.  All of the main characters in the game you can attempt to become friends or enemies with, ally with them or betray them, let them live or kill them (or let them get killed).  The RPG elements are a split of perks for performing certain actions or accomplishments, and a selection of skills and specialties to suit your play style.

Personally, I view this more as DLC as I think the Mario campaign is the primary game-play people should experience first, before playing this.

Super Luigi U is one of the best bits of console-based dlc that Nintendo has done.  Some criticize that they just altered the Levels from NSMBU.  Who cares!? the level design from the Mario version is amazing and is super fun.  The altered physics and altered levels make this worth every penny to me as the whole game plays differently, and there is an added time constraint; making continuous progression a do-or-die scenario.  It's super fun and now that me friend and I have 100% completed the Mario campaign, we're going to try to do it for Luigi U (yea the thought scares me a bit).

My only complaint, is that they could have at least re-worked the bosses too.  Knowing how to out-fox the same bosses moves (If you played Mario Bros U) sort of takes away from the end of world reward, but it's still fun nonetheless.

Questions that have been brewing for years come to a climax, and there were quite a few 'oh my...' moments throughout.

The combat is greatly improved over previous games, combos are easy to execute, and a blast to use.

Pros:
-The Visuals and environments were fantastic, especially in HD.
-The controls were simple and effective.
-Character development was spot on.
-The quests were fairly self explanatory and there was no shortage of them.
-Weapons and armor were well done and the choices and combinations of each were fairly abundant.
-The choice based system was great but left a little to be desired (which is why this same statement will be a con as well).
-Damage taken throughout the game shows on your characters body.
-Character aging...and certain things age you faster, like heavy magic use.  But certain things can make you younger.

Cons:
-The choice based system was great but left a little to be desired.  For instance, when you are trying to be good, killing attacking people like bandits counts as an evil deed.  I guess the game expects you to run from all fights.
-The game sort of feels incomplete, even the Lost Chapters version.  The original felt much more incomplete though...mainly because it was.
-The targeting system was pretty poorly done.  During magic use especially, you would often target friendlies and cause very bad things to happen.

Trick Runs:
This is SSX's bread and butter, and where the game truly shines.  There is something incredibly fun about grinding along a section of the Great Wall while while doing a handstand on your board, then jumping into some 1040 degree spinning backflip while break dancing on your board in mid air.  Puts a smile on my face every time.  I can't say enough good things about the trick courses, I really have no complaints with this part of the game it all.  Very creative, each region has a unique feel, and you never get tired of it.  The only reason that I didn't give it an A+ is that there are a few courses missing. Specifically:
Where is Tokyo Megaplex?
Where is Perpendiculous?
Where is Metro City?

Add those classic course back in, and maybe a totally new, mind blowing half pipe, and you will will get an A+.  Come up with a totally original course as unique and unreal as Tokyo Megaplex again, and it will be above and beyond.  Don't forget that this game is supposed to ""Defy Reality.""

Racing:
Who designed the race runs on this game?  Seriously, I don't know what gamer hating, sadistic, malicious idiot designed the race courses, but they owe every SSX fan an apology.  That is not a joke, I am dead serious, I want to see an apologetic press release.  Go buy Tricky and SSX Three, and see if you can figure out where you screwed up.  If I want to play some uber serious snowboard sim that was true to life and forced a reboot every thirty seconds because I fell into yet another crevasse that I couldn't see until I was in it, I wouldn't have bought an SSX title!  I'm here to throw big tricks and do crazy, unrealistic runs that you can't do in real life. Oh, and rewind mode?  That may be the most worthless game edition in the history of mankind for race mode.  I rewind, everyone else keeps going.  Not helpful.  I rewind, and despite trying to change events and hitting different buttons, the same exact thing happens.  Thanks, that was a big help.  Look, it is kind of impossible to try and worry about winning the race when you are focusing every ounce of your will power on staying on the three foot wide path and not falling of the cliffs all around you.  Not fun.  Restarting the race every time you fall in a hole?  Also not fun.

The best part about the race modes in Tricky and SSX 3 was finding your own route down the mountain, and turning a losing run into a winning run by finding a shortcut.  These narrow pathed death traps don't allow you to do that.  They also don't allow you to trick much either, since you are desperately trying to discern whether or not some giant hole of cavern is waiting to swallow you whole if you dare jump.  Are you such a masochist that you actually enjoyed playing this crap?  I didn't.  I can assure you, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that now that I have beaten world tour, I will NEVER play another race on this game.  Not ONE.

Survival / Deadly Descents:
Verdict: Meh.  Some of these can be somewhere between challenging and fun.  Some are just incredibly stupid.  Guess how I got through Alaska's Invincible and Emergency Exit (the deadly descent) courses? I put the controller down.  That's right, I survived one of your ""Deadly Descents"" without touching the controller.  Frankly, that's a good thing, too.  I don't know what troglodytic crackhead decided that it was a good idea to set these runs up with a reverse camera angle, so you can't see where you are going, but if I had been forced to play through that crap over and over again, I would have returned the game.  WORST. LEVEL. EVER.  The most disappointing part?  Avalanches was one of the challenges I was looking forward to.  They should have been pretty cool.  Instead, they were just pointless.  Frankly, Darkness was pretty pointless as well.  This is especially true since not one of my repeated deaths in Africa was due to not being able to see.  I died because I took a jump and fell in a hole, or came over a hill or around a turn and fell into a crack that wasn't visible until I was already falling into it. Woo.  What fun.  By the way, since falling into holes and off of cliffs is the primary method of death in this game, shouldn't that have been one of the Deadly Descents?  Would have made more sense to just turn the lights on in Africa and say, ""Good luck, try not to fall in!""

Gravity, Rock, Ice, and Trees were all pretty amusing, though.  Wingsuits at least lived up to the hype.  The others manage to be fun and challenging without feeling forced, which is far more than I can say for Avalanche.  Fans of the originals that are used to hitting trees on the way down will enjoy laughing about this part of the survival mode, where you are actually tasked with NOT plowing into every obstacle in your path.  Pretty amusing, really.

Storyline:
Retarded.  Hmmm....  I wonder who can manage to fly around the world and ride 9 different mountains first, a whole team of riders, or one lone guy?  Why didn't team SSX just ride all the courses simultaneously?  This was just stupid.  The only part they did right was making Griff the villain.  Everyone hated Griff, he was a little tool.  On the plus side, who the hell plays an SSX game for the storyline?

Characters:
All the classics are still here, with a few additions.  Unfortunately, they are pretty stripped down.  Even Psymon is barely recognizable, and doesn't really carry any personality.  Bring the original voice actors back, and give them the personalities we all love.  Mostly, just give them personalities.  A few more unique tricks wouldn't hurt, and some of the pointless but light hearted gear from SSX 3 wouldn't hurt.  The bonus characters like the skeleton riding a coffin were awesome.

Features:
Online modes are incredible.  The ghost runs may be the best innovation for SSX or for online play that I have ever even heard of.  Incredible addition that makes the game much more fun and competitive.  Amazing idea, and well executed.  The same can be said for the global events.  I hate lobbies, so the lack of that setup in SSX is a blessing. The music in the game as absolutely horrendous, but fortunately you can use your own instead, which the game seems to remix depending on what you are doing on the course, which is really cool. The two negatives here are pretty simple.  Fail number one: 720p, not 1080.  WTF?  Fail number two: NO LOCAL MULTIPLAYER!  Guys, as much effort as you put into the online modes, why would you leave out split screen play?  What where you thinking?

BOTTOM LINE:
If you were hoping for some epic trick runs, and some incredible, innovative online play, pick it up.  The tricks are a blast, just have some patience beating the World Tour and unlocking everything.  If you were a race fan, skip it.  The race runs suck.  Just aggravating for the sake of aggravating.  Fortunately, I came for the tricks.

Why four stars, with so many complaints?  At the end of the day, now that I have beaten World Tour, I can skip and ignore the runs I don't like.  I bought the game to throw tricks and compete online.  That part of the game is brilliant and amazingly fun.  I'll be playing this one for a while.

So we were really looking forward to playing the sequel, figuring everything would just be better -- because aren't sequels ALWAYS better than the originals? Well, R6V2 has some definite improvements over the original -- most notably the quality of the graphics and the more frequent saving of checkpoints so every time you both get killed you don't have to start over at the beginning of the entire level. And R6V2 is still loads of fun. But we've also got a couple of major gripes, so here they are:

(1) The game may be fun for four players, but for two players it can be really annoying. Why? Because no matter how many actual humans are playing the game, you're always in a team of four characters. That means that the characters that are NOT being played by humans are played by the computer. And most of the time, these ""extra"" characters just get in the way. These extra characters didn't exist in R6V1 so the two-player gameplay was a lot more fun and a lot less annoying.

(2) The grenade/infrared buttons have been switched. If you're using to playing R6V1, then you're used to pressing the Circle button for infrared and R2 for throwing a grenade. In the sequel, those two buttons are reversed. And so whenever you want to use infrared, you end up throwing a grenade instead. Not sure why the developers thought switching those buttons would make for better gameplay, but my friend and I have ""committed suicide"" several times because we were TRYING to enter infrared mode.

Other than that, a lot of what made R6V1 so fun can still be found in R6V2, so it's not like the sequel sucks. It's still a great game -- it just falls shy of being on the shortlist for sequels that surpass the originals.",A Great Sequel with Two Major Annoyances,1269043200,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

The beautiful scenic shots in certain parts of the game is what really amazed me and unlike anything I've seen in other games.  I know a game is great when even if I've been playing the game for a while, I don't want it to end and I felt that while playing this game.  Disappointed this is supposed to be the last game in the franchise (or so they say now).  In my opinion, Uncharted 1 was good, but started getting to the point later in the game where I was beating it just to beat it.  Uncharted 2 took it up a level and I thought that game was awesome.  Uncharted 3 was even better than that.  To me, Uncharted 4 is about on par with Uncharted 3.  If you're a fan of the series, definitely worth playing.  If you're new to the series, get the bundle pack that comes with games 1-3 and play those first.  One of my favorite things about these games are the cinematic action scenes where you may be escaping somewhere that's crumbling down or jumping between cars and etc.

4.0,True,"09 3, 2013",AKN754MGTTQOP,B00BHSTXV6,Brian Lafond,"I've been in desperate need of a new keyboard for a while. My Logitech keyboard held up for years but was on it's last leg and I suffered through the months waiting for this baby to be released. Announced at CES in January, it didn't come to market until August 2013.

I was surprised to see it for sale on Amazon as the Steel Series website still had a link to ""notify me"" when it became available (It is now for sale on their website as well) but I jumped on the chance to buy the keyboard I've been waiting months to get my hands on.

Pros:
- The lights look amazing, and the colors can be very rich.\
- In addition to the numerous dedicated macro keys, you can reconfigure any key on the keyboard to any other key / macro combination of keys. This creates a lot of potential for gaming.
- Sturdy high quality construction
- Membrane keys are nice and quiet and actuate smoothly. Personally, I'm not a fan of mechanical keyboards so this is definitely a plus for me. Definitely one of the best membrane keyboards on the market.

Cons:
- It's hard to distinguish between some colors. While they advertise millions of color combinations are possible, many colors are muddled and indistinguishable. I tend to stick with the more vivid color options.
- While it has 8 levels of brightness, even the brightest setting isn't particularly bright in a fully lit room. This keyboard looks stunning in the dark though
- The software / drivers seem like they need some work. Day 1 I had a BSOD attributed to the USB driver. I think it's the 2 USB ports on the keyboard. I wouldn't use them for crucial data transfer / external hard drives.
- The keyboard is fairly flat, even with the taller rubber feet attached. Also,the keys are very flat, and it takes some getting used to. Expect a lot of typos and accidental caps lock at first.

Overall, this is a really sleek keyboard and the lights look great. 4 profiles and unlimited macro options make this keyboard ideal for hardcore gamers, but it works very well for causal PC usage as well. The keyboard is comfortable to type on for extended periods of time. It is a LARGE keyboard, so expect it to take up a fair amount of room on your desk.",Sexy keyboard with TONS of macros,1378166400,,{'Style:': ' Apex'},

The best 2-D fighter on any home console (with Marvel vs. Capcom 2 a CLOSE second) finally arrives on the DC.  Capcom may have yet to learn how to count past three (heck, it took 'em eight years to get past TWO!) but this one is absolutely the greatest of the Street Fighter series.  The characters are plentiful (19 in all); their animation, just like the box ad says, seamless (if a tad pixelated).  Gameplay is just like we Street Fighter fans like it; with the addition of a few new tricks (like parrying and leap attacks to confuse low-blockers).  Backgrounds are beautiful as usual, and some of the items in the stages interact with the fight (like the leaves shifting on the ground when someone's head makes impact with it).  The music's great too; a nice blend of jazz/fusion and cranking guitar.  All that and the return of fan-favorite Chun-Li make for a wonderful fighting experience for just about anyone.  You'll have some good fun with figuring out the new parrying system, the super arts, bonus stages, etc. as well.  Even though the gameplay may be a little simplistic to some (especially Marvel vs. Capcom 2 fans), it's complex in its simplicity and should give you at least a few months of steady play, which is pretty good for a fighting game.  The only reasons I gave it four stars is that the computer opponents are rather hard to beat, and if you're new to fighting games, that's trouble; and while the fighters move as fluidly as running water, they look a little too rough around the edges for Dreamcast standards, especially when they were hand-drawn.","""Choose and pick the best one...""",972259200,7,,

4.0,True,"05 27, 2014",A1WFTIOEH30UJY,B00HD4R5YU,Cadence Serna,"Most of the reviews shown here are angry due to the overall amount of content you are getting for your money here.  You will see people complain that they finished it in one day...many in one sitting.  I won't say that these people are saying anything that isn't true; the game's storyline can be completed (or should I say ""experienced"") in under an hour.

However, I offer a different perspective.  In my first play through, I completed the story in 176 minutes.  Yes, it took me 3 hours to complete it on my first try.  My ending grade was a D.  This is when the typical ""Dur hur...u suck at metal gear lolz"" comments come in, and I welcome them.  I haven't played a Metal Gear game since the HD re-release of 2, 3, and Peacewalker.  The idea that I wasn't immediately acclimated to the new interface, the new sneaking system, and the new controls combined with having not played the franchise in years makes me quite comfortable with whatever shortcomings I had during current gameplay.
Also, with my D rating on my first run through, I got a whopping 6% completion rating.

With all of that said, I put 3 hours into the game and have completed 6% of it and finished the story with an unsatisfactory grade.  My second play through lasted half the time and I got an A rating...completion percentage: 9%.

My questions are for the people who can't come to grips with the brevity of the game:

Would you have felt any better if the game took you, at the rate in which you complete video games, over 12 hours to complete?  If you blaze through video games at this rate, is the experience you had with Ground Zeros really that uncommon?  If you decided to stop playing after your first play through, and you haven't completed everything the game has to offer, aren't you the ones who are wasting your money?  To me that's like buying a jar of peanut butter, making one sandwich from it, then throwing the other 95% of the jar in the trash.

The amount of production hours put into Ground Zeros include so much that isn't seen in a 7 minute speed run of the game's main story.  I'd totally be on the side of the complainers if my first run through the game took me 3 hours, I got a D, and had like 80% completion.  But instead I got access to like 3 other missions, a list of secondary goals to reach, XOF patches (I didn't find any on my first play through, 2 on my second), and so much more.

Personally, I enjoyed this game very much.  No demo has this much content and this much replay value.  You usually see this level of replayability AFTER the release of the final product.  I'll be playing this game for at least a couple more weeks, and frankly the only complaints I have about it are some of the highly implausible parts of the story that I can't talk about because it would spoil the game play for those who haven't experienced it (there's a reason why you get locked out of recording the cutscenes at the end).",Don't believe the gripe.,1401148800,4,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'},

It's a match 3 puzzle game with RPG elements. However it's not as simple as Candy Crush or Pokemon Shuffle. The goal isn't just to match three, but to shuffle pieces around on the board for a limited amount of time for the purpose of creating multiple combos to make stronger attacks against enemies. The RPG elements come into play because you have level up and evolve characters to make them more powerful

THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. THERE ARE NO MAGIC STONES, NO MICROTRANSACTIONS, NO STAMINA BAR. You progress through the level by completing it. If you fail a level and you have lives, you get the opportunity to continue trying to defeat that enemy (similar to magic stones in the mobile game) if you run out of lives, you simply have to start that level from the beginning again. You can't buy better anything, all of it is acquired while playing, including eggs.

The challenge depends on how well you understand the concept or how much experience you have with the mobile game. You have to understand elemental weaknesses (like grass is effective against water, fire against grass; your basic pokemon like stuff)

Moving onto what you get in the box. These are two completely full games. The SMB edition has 16 worlds with 8 levels each which will average you about 16 hours to complete. Puzzle and Dragons Z is set up like a pokemon game where you traverse around town, talk to other characters and take sidequests (usually finding an item in a specific dungeon) and amount to about 20-25 hours. You can play them both at the same time (ONLY ONE SAVE FILE FOR EACH GAME!) or can choose to complete one and then the other. Both have good tutorials so it doesn't matter. While you might expect the Mario game to be more for newcomers, it's actually the more punishing game of the two.

If you're still a little unsure about whether or not you'll enjoy this, there is a demo out on the e-shop for the Super Mario Bros Edition and of course the free to play mobile game on phones and tablets.",Everything you loved about the mobile game without the wait and invisible barriers,1432684800,3,,

5.0,False,"11 9, 2008",A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00175GC3Q,Caleb Williams,"The Smackdown game series since about Here Comes the Pain has been on a downward spiral. Many loyal fans of the series abandoning it because they felt like THQ were putting the minimal effort into the game, simply because they knew it would sell. In many ways they were justified for turning their back on the series as it gave THQ the wake up call they needed. This game seems like one of the very first games in the series that a hell of a lot of effort was put into it. With a massive roster, an easy to use yet detailed controlling system and a beefed up tag system this game was bound to be a success. First off THQ needs to reassure the abandoning fans that this is a very different game from the originals. One way in doing that is giving them one thing the fans have always wanted, a ""create a finisher"" mode. The very notion that you can now create your own finisher is something that the fans think will make a massive difference to such a game. Anyway, the modes are going to be discussed in a minute but in a nutshell this game is really good.

The Roster: This contains over 60 wrestlers, none of them legends but the sheer size of the roster itself is enough to allow you to effectively use the newly updated tag team system. The real gem for this particular installment is the announcement that in order to keep the rosters from becoming out dated, THQ are going to finally utilise the Playstation Network by allowing downloadable content. This will not only feature wrestlers but will allow other additions such as possible new storylines or looks for current superstars to match what is going on in TV land. The first announcement of the DLC is although there is not yet a date, superstars Evan Bourne and Ted DiBiase Jr. are confirmed to be a part of it along with a few other little things.

Game Modes: In exchange for the previous installments WWE 24/7 mode, we're now given Road to Wrestlemania and Career Mode. Road to Wrestlemania is essentially a shortened Season Mode starting from around the Royal Rumble and is tailor made for specific superstars. A drawback to this is that you can only play as either Triple H, CM Punk, Undertaker, John Cena, Chris Jericho or Batista & Rey Mysterio as part of a co-op RTW play. There's also a career mode which is basically a never ending thing with no story, it's just fight to earn a shot at a title, win, then fight for another title. You can do that with anyone.

There's also the new Create A Finisher which I haven't tried yet but will get around to eventually. I've never really been fan of the create a wrestler things so if you really want to know then I'd check out other reviews.

To wrap it up in 4 simple words? I Love This Game. It's fun, it's easy and it's packed. The only problem is that when I've managed to complete all the RTW's I can imagine becoming quite un-interested with it until we get the DLC anyway. Hopefully along with new superstars, THQ will be able to give us new RTW storylines and arenas to keep us occupied with the DLC until the next installment. This type of thing will also allow THQ to give us a lot more to the game with constant updates instead of trying to put as much on the disc as possible before release date.

I'm also praying that trophies will follow eventually although it's looking doubtful for this particular installment. I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone who's a fan of wrestling.",A Real Improvement.,1226188800,16,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

5.0,True,"01 11, 2010",AL8M1UQW6F7OR,B002HJYKG2,coolgamer,"What a great addition to the Harvest Moon series! I think it is definitely HM at it's best, no doubt.

For those new to the series, the concept is that you are a farmer-rancher who just moved to town. You are given a house, introduced to the townspeople and started a new life. Once you get to your new abode and settle into the town, your mission is to find the Harvest Goddess. Once you talk to her, the problem becomes clear: there are five bells missing and you must find them all to restore the power of nature, reviving the Goddess Tree. Along the way, Finn, a harvest sprite, will guide you. You also have the option to seek the love of bachelors and bachelorettes, provided you know just what they like. A major feature in Animal Parade which differs greatly from other HM titles are the animals. Throughout the ""world"" you will find and be able to befriend wild animals, if you so choose.

So thats the basis of the game. I will now break up my review into parts:

STORY: I love the adventure in this game! Your quest to find the bells pretty much starts once you locate the Harvest Goddess, and at this point the adventure takes off.  You have to complete one side-quest or two before you can actually speak with the Harvest Goddess and begin your quest, but these are simple and take three game days at most. She makes it clear on what your goal is and you can always go back if you have questions. But Finn is very helpful by always giving you hints and guiding you in your mission. Personally, I was able to deduce what I had to do before Finn told me, but if you get stuck then Finn will definitely help (sometimes I did need him to point me in the right direction). The first bell you get provides just the right amount of challenge. Once you get the red bell, this opens up the option to find all the other bells. This really gets the game going. I loved how the adventure was an integral part of the game, not just some optional thing. It is a blast trying to find all the bells because you have to interact with a lot of the townspeople to do so. You might have to complete some side-quests for them or have certain items in order to proceed, but it is always fun and rewarding once completed.

TOWN: The town is well made. I like how there are several places to explore. You can visit Harmonica Town, Garmon Mines, and Flute Fields. Toucan Island only becomes available later in the game (I haven't gotten it yet). Within each place are worlds within worlds, so there is more to explore once you get somewhere. The load screens aren't too bad, either. At first they become tedious, but then you just get used to it. They really aren't that bad, it just gets annoying to see the name of the place pop up every time you go somewhere.

TOWNSFOLK: What I love most about the people in this game is that they are very good hint-droppers. Sometimes they make it really obvious and other times I have to kind of deduce what they are saying, but its funny at how they give me little hints on what to do. There is a good variety on people and they each play a role in the game. It is fun that they give side-quests for you to do, especially since they usually lead to your progression in the game, not just something to do and you get no reward.

DATING: I'm not gonna lie, its hard to get hearts in this game. So far I am at the end of spring (not so far into the game yet but I've been playing it) and I have more hearts with the animals than I do with people. In fact, I have no people hearts. The eligible girls and boys are wide in variety so if you like a certain trade (mining, cooking, jewelry-making, fishing, etc) there is most likely a bachelor/ette perfect for you. Luckily the friends menu allows you to see what each person likes and dislikes, making it easier to give gifts that win points. However so far I've noticed those recommendations only show items that people ""like."" I have yet to figure out what they truly love and what will earn me hearts. You can also track people on the menu, making it easy to give gifts if you can't find someone.

ANIMALS: I really like the addition of animals to the town. Not only can you have livestock, but there are several animals roaming in the wild. Each location has its own animals. So far I've met such a variety as dogs, cats, boar, squirrel, snake, raccoon, rabbit, frog, turtle, bear, and many more! Its really fun to discover new ones. You can make friends with any animal you meet by visiting it frequently and feeding it something it likes. Like for friends, the wild animal menu shows what they like and dislike. The location stays the same but some only stick around in a particular season or climate, so you'll always know where to find your favorites. If you get enough heart points with an animal, they can become your pet and help you around the game. With the starting house you receive, you can only have pet but once you expand, you get to have more and more. I thought this was a great addition to the game concept.

DIFFICULTY: This game is in the middle. It is not painstakingly hard (obviously its HM) nor is it ridiculously easy (again its HM). It has the right amount of challenge for the seasoned HM fan/gamer but enough hints for newcomers. I would recommend it to any wii fan and especially to fans of the HM series.

CONTROLS: The controls are straightforward and easy. One thing that bothered me for a little was some lack of explanation in the manual. They don't tell you that when you buy new furniture you have to open up the furniture menu to place it. This frustrated me for a while but then I got it. Its not a big deal but they could have explained that in the manual. Another thing is the camera. No complaints there except that sometimes you can't see a path, which means you're missing an entire entrance to a new location. Luckily I was exploring and happened to find this new stretch of beach that was barely visible unless I had been really looking (it was on the edge of the screen thats why, most locations are clearly visible). If I hadn't stumbled across this one path, I don't know how long it would have taken me to find the yellow bell. Guess I was lucky! But other than that, the controls are super.

DS vs WII: I've gotta say I prefer HM on the wii any day. I have island of happiness for ds, and while its a fun game, HM is the type of game that I feel plays better on the Wii. The big screen allows you to experience the world better. You can explore more thoroughly and the graphics are so much better. Overall its just a better gaming experience on the Wii when it comes to HM.

I know this is a long review but I wanted to be thorough. Thanks for reading it all! This is a great addition to any Wii game collection and while it is somewhat addicting, I think its a lot of fun and has good replay value and longevity for a game. Definitely worth the price. A whole lotta fun! I would recommend playing the whole game and taking advantage of everything; don't skip the adventure, thats the best part! Oh and the animals, too!

Have fun!",Find the bells!,1263168000,257,,

5.0,True,"04 19, 2014",A1Z847VYBJ9H9A,B004FZ9822,Robert Kiehn,"Amnesia:TDD is one of the best and scariest games I have ever played in my entire life.

The story of the game takes place in the 1900's (around 1840 to 1860, I think, though it could be later)
and puts you in the role of Daniel, who was in Algeria on an archeological expedition for the British Museum
when Daniel stumbles upon a room with an orb in it, when he collects the orb, he blacks and becomes trapped
in the room for about an hour, but is eventually rescued.

Daniel returns home to Great Britain after his ordeal, only to have people he has come in contact with
mysteriously die horrible deaths. Daniel writes to several people, in the hopes that he can find out why
they are dy9ing after he has contact with them, esp. something that was chasing him and killed some
locals he passed... Something is chasing Daniel, something of pure evil and killing everyone he comes
into contact with. An ancient evil, perhaps. After the orb he has.

I will not spoil the story anymore except to say that the Count of Castle Brennenberg in Prussia offers
Daniel help and the rest of the story unfolds in the game through notes, journals, memos, flashbacks, etc.

The game is played from a first person perspective, and is very dark, as it takes place in a castle at night time
and their is no electricity, only certain areas and rooms with pre-lit candles, torches and lanterns.

The game has puzzles you must solve, though they are not that hard and most people can eventually solve them
by using their heads.

The game is indeed very tense, unnerving and scary, however monsters don't appear until the middle of the game.

Some other points to keep in mind:

Amnesia is a true survival horror game, no weapons similar to Silent Hill: Shattered Memories (I think).

You cannot kill enemies/monsters, only hide from them in the dark or try and run from them and lose them.

Lot's of exploration, this is not an action game but an adventure one.

There are horrors/monsters in this game.

The setting is scary, moody and tense as are the levels in the castle you'll be exploring.

Great physics engine, your character can carry certain items like boxes and chairs and even stack them up or use them to block or stun monsters.

Monsters can run fast and kill you in one or two swipes.

You have a handheld lantern you eventually find, but it requires oil every so often to keep lit.

In dark areas, you also have tinderboxes that can be used to light candles, fireplaces, torches,
other lanterns, etc.

Levels/rooms/areas are well designed and decorated even.

Graphics are nice and detailed though very dark most of the time unless you are in a lighted area
or have oil for your lantern. Might have to turn up the brightness and gamma of the game and your
monitor to boot.

Sound and sound effects are great, scary and downright tense plus creepy too. Love the drum beats!

Controls are good as is inventory management of items found and keeping track of notes, etc.

Memo's sometimes give you hints of what to do next or what to do in general.

Custom story's add life to the game, created by other users (Don't forget to download from
Fractional Games the Justine expansion pack and also The Things in the Night from Doom2299,
Markiplier on youtube also did an awesome 28 part video series of this custom story).

Great story and characters in general (Look on Amnesia Wikia though spoilers abound btw).

Does indeed remind me of certain horror movies and game (i.e. Hellrasier, Resident Evil, Silent Hill,
and a few others, horror books included).

All in all I give this game 5/5 stars for being somewhat original and it does indeed remind me
a bit of Silent Hill plus Resident Evil and a few other games. I recommend strongly it.

p.s. Play it at night, alone, in the dark with headphones on.

For more info look on Amnesia: The Dark Descent TV Tropes page, GameFAQ'd and
Amnesia:TDD Wikia as well as for reviews of this game from not only here but PC Gamer,
IGN, GameSpot, etc.

I highly recommend the secret ending of the game, but if you actually go through the game, you'll be faced with two possible people to support the decisions of.

I like the fact that you get your briefing, head out, listen in on your wingmen if you want, and strike your targets.  If you run out of ordnance (missiles, bombs, and gun ammo), you can fly back to your base or carrier to reload and have your bird repaired.  My only gripe about this game is it's a bit difficult to save up funds to buy new planes.  I have this and Ace Combat 5, and I liked this one the best.  Ace combat 5 has a storyline that flows over into your actual mission flight, which I find annoying, In Ace Combat 5, you can't upgrade or choose weapons for the planes, whereas you can in Ace Combat 4.  And Ace Combat 5 forces you to ""unlock"" new planes, VERY ANNOYING; in Ace Combat 4, the planes become available as you move along in the campaign.  And in Ace Combat 5, you cannot fly back to base to repair and rearm.... EXTREMELY ANNOYING!!.  some of the missions in AC5 are really annoying, such as following an old ace pilot to run away, flying a recon mission to take pictures.... with only ten camera shots.  In Ace Combat 4, you just attack your targets and defend a few allies, much more direct and to the point.

The game has a good balance of action and adventuring/puzzle solving. Lots of stuff to find which translates to great replay value for me.

Once you complete a level/chapter of a movie, of the original trilogy,  you unlock freeplay mode. So you can go back through the level and really explore it and find all the goodies you missed the first time around. You can also play as any character you have unlocked. Very cool indeed!

The levels are fun and not too difficult which is perfect for me because I don't want a game that frustrates me more than it entertains me.

So what makes it better?
The graphics for one. SC was no slouch, but fabulous  architecture does not make up for flat, geometrical fighting stages. DOA2  easily surpasses SC and earns many kudos for fabulous interior design,  coupled with multi-tiered fighting stages (nothing like throwing someone  through a cathedral window to the courtyard below, is there?). Also, the  characters in DOA2 feel like characters moving through 3 dimensional space  (their clothing moves with them) as opposed to wire frames with bitmapped  skins. And their expressions match the task at hand, unlike Soul Caliber  where the contestants look either constipated or happy to get  beat up.
Two: the audio. Both SC and DOA2 have the original  Japanese voice actors, but whereas SC makes a player cringe (horrible,  horrible translation job), DOA2 makes it believeable. The voice acting is  on the money. Whether a player likes the rock and roll BGM (with some asian  and classical fusion) is a matter of preference, but it fits the overall  feel of the came to a T.
Three: Lightening quick load times. The engine  loads once before the fight and everything moves seamlessly from  there.
Other noteworthy features:
Cut scenes which are a cut above.  Visually, nothing compares. Some RPG fans might be screaming ""you call  that story development? "" but they they get the job done - in  style.
DOA2's hand to hand combat mode is pretty easy to pick up. You'll  be flipping and kicking in under ten minutes (even my mother won a few  rounds, and she NEVER plays video games). And the training mode is super  friendly for those who want to master the aerial arsenal. Also, while the  characters are each unique with their own moves, they're all pretty much  evenly matched. There is no ONE super character. (It doesn't make much  sense reality wise, but it makes for a great fighting game.)
Some people  have complained that DOA2 lacks ""secret"" features, but I prefer  having all the characters available as opposed to having to play countless  rounds with characters I don't like to ""unlock"" my desired  choice.
Of course, the game does have it's drawbacks: limited costumes,  only 12 (or is it 14?)characters, way too many gratuitous panty shots (at  least as far as this female gamer is concerned), lack of stage selection in  survival and team battle modes, but the truth: you're not going to notice  them. You'll be to happy with what IS available.
I'm glad I own both SC  and DOA2, but if I could only keep one, it'd be DOA2.",A superior fighting game! Worth the money!,962928000,14,,

Both of these games are full-length games, though a little shorter than the average adventure game. If you're an adventure & puzzle game lover like me, you will get many hours of enjoyment out of the two Drawn games. Both are combination adventure (point-and-click inventory based) and puzzle games. The Painted Tower is definitely a five-star game. The artwork is great, the story-line interesting and the puzzles, wow, the puzzles were varied and inventive and fun.

I thought Dark Flight was a little easier than The Painted Tower, with the exception of three very large puzzles, two of which I had to find a walkthrough to help me through. But the artwork is still great and I certainly recommend it.

I know seven people (not including myself) that own this and every single person is absolutely addicted. This is the best zombie game I have ever played in my opinion. It is as if someone took the left for dead franchise and added similar elements of games like fallout and borderlands. The people on here that write these ten paragraph reviews on why they don't like the game, and state so many individual reasons, just goes to show you, that their mindset is ""what can I find about this game that I don't like so I can complain about it on a review for a solid two hours"".

Other time-involve games either jumped years forward or back in time, or used cheezy VCR symbols to handle your time changes. In Sands of Time, it's extremely easy to use and VERY handy. You fall off a ledge? Just slide back in time a bit and try again!
The graphics are just amazing. The character moves fluidly, and the combat sequences look like a well animated movie. The character can run along walls, do back flips, climb poles, leap chasms, and much more. When he runs along a wall and passes a banner, the banner ripples in the wind. The attention to detail - from shadows to textures to torches flickering and water rippling - is just amazing.
Part of the game is slaying your enemies in new and interesting ways. But part is negotiating the terrain and figuring out how to get to the next area. Some of the puzzles are straightforward - run along the wall, jump up the ledges. But others are far more devious and require a lot of thought to get through.
There are many great releases out right now that we are enjoying greatly, but Sands of Time is the one that always draws the most fascinated reactions from friends. They comment constantly on the graphics, animation and gameplay while we move from scene to scene. It's like poetry in motion. And it's fun.

So the Infowar is on and Alex Jones is leading the charge, oh wait ahh.. LOL ya this game was based around a Alt-right Alex Jones character leading humanity against the globalist and in case of the game it's anti-augmentation vs. the augmentation. If you like story driven games about things we are facing actually in reality with the technocrates wanting to merge with machines and be come gods then you'll love this game. The game is short so if you can find a cheap copy like I did for $20 then pick it up. Their no ground breaking stuff here it just continues the story a fews years after Humankind divided their also no new ground really broke here either it a good game just not the leap forward one would of like to have saw. Anyways If you can get it cheap Buy it.

Graphics: 9 - Beautiful Game.

Audio: 9 - Great sound.

Game-play: 7.0 - Nothing new really and in someways less then Human Divided.

Controls: 8.- Good controls like every other FPS Action RPG.

Story: 8.5 - Good story. If you want to know where humanity stands get this game.

5.0,True,"03 12, 2017",A2VWPJGE6YSGAN,B00FQDEKM0,Kurgan,"Want to play the original Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo and NES cartridges from the 80's and 90's on real hardware on your TV? Love those old cartridges but can't afford working hardware to play them or just want to save some shelf space in the living room? For those who nodded your head enthusiastically, your solution has come!

For decades purist fans would have you track down the original game consoles and accept nothing less. Now thanks to retro-bit, you can finally find a ""solution"" that is a brand new console, one that does it about 99% as good as the originals. This is coming from an old school American gaming fan who had Genesis back in the day and also played a lot of NES (and a little SNES too now and then) in the final decades of the 20th century.

Now that the hardware trademarks for the original consoles have expired, there have been a proliferation of ""famiclones"" and ""system on a chip"" remakes of the original Nintendo and Sega game consoles, which allow collectors to play the original game cartridges even if they never owned the original hardware (or if it's died or they want to put it into storage). Enter the Super Retro Trio, which to me is the pinnacle of this development so far.

Sadly, a lot of attention has been given to this system's chief competitor, the Retron 5. Here is the difference:

Retron 5 is a stripped down computer that runs the games via emulation. Retro Trio is the original hardware.
This means the R5 can do blurring effects, cheat patches and stuff like that, but it's still emulation, not the real thing, there's glitches, and also load times that were never present in the original games. My opinion is if you're going to go with emulation, you might as well just play it on a PC, since it's going to be easier to update anyway, unless you're completely non-computer savvy, but chances are you are if you're into emulated retro gaming.

Retron 5 doesn't use the original controller. It has some weirdo proprietary controller that resembles nothing from the original systems. Yes, supposedly you can hook up the original controllers, but out of the box you're stuck with this weird thing. Retro Trio comes with two Super NES style controllers (that feel great, I'm sure only a hardcore SNES player could tell the difference other than the color scheme) that have genesis style plugs (they can be used for any of the 3 systems, but there are plugs to hook up any of the 3 systems controllers and you can switch between them at will, though you need the right number of buttons obviously for certain games).

Retron5 plays Gameboy Advance games (through emulation) while Retro Trio advertises an addon cartridge that plays GBA (sold seperately and has its own power supply). Most people probably don't care enough, but if you got this to play GBA on your TV, this might be an extra hassle.

Cost wise, the Retron5 is much more expensive, but easier to find in game shops and stores while the Super Retro Trio you'll have to buy online. Still, while the price fluctuates, you can get the Trio for $65 (for some reason the red & black version is cheaper than the white and blue or black and silver versions).

I've read articles saying that the Retron5 used emulation software without the permission of those programmers and that there are glitches requiring firmware updates. Overall I'm glad I went with the Super Retro Trio instead.

I have 50+ Sega Genesis cartridges (and two Megadrive carts: Double Dragon II The Revenge and Golden Axe III) which are tested and working on the Super Retro Trio, so compatibility is good. I've heard a few games don't work or have glitches, but I don't own these games so can't comment. The ONLY issue I had with any genesis game was with Lethal Enforcers, which didn't recognize the ""Justifier"" lightgun included, instead you have to use the standard controller.

I have about a dozen NES games I tested and the only issues I noticed where a couple of games had slightly altered color palettes which I only noticed because I've played these games so much. For instance, the original Super Mario Bros. has a bright blue sky in the early levels, instead of the subdued purple/indigo that was there originally. It's more like the blue background of the water levels you play later on. I think I noticed some different colored backgrounds in Duck Hunt as well. This doesn't affect game play obviously and it's not distracting once you get used to it.

For Super NES, here is the biggest issue. See, the console comes in a box with all its parts, and the thing is pretty lightweight and doesn't get too hot when being used. The plug is pretty easy to fit somewhere (it's not a giant brick like some of the originals came with). The video plugs are RCA composite (red, white, yellow). The original Genesis had a stereo plug for headphones (the Genesis model 2 & 3 didn't have this, neither does the Super Retro Trio). Anyway, there is also an ""S-Video"" plug for better graphics. The original Genesis came with an RF Modulator (which was a little blurrier and had some waviness to it compared to the much sharper Composite video) but RCA was available so that's fine. NES had composite with mono (here it's stereo, but it's more like fake stereo with the same thing through both speakers). The SNES on the other hand, seems to glitch up or not display the picture if you try to use RCA. So what it comes down to is that whenever you want to play SNES, you basically have to unplug the yellow video from composite and insert the S-Video. When you're playing NES or Genesis, you swap back. This can be annoying. At first it didn't seem to matter, but then when I tried to play Super Nintendo games I got sound but no picture, and had to go with S-Video exclusively (Sometimes having to power down the system and unplug it multiple times before it synched back again with the picture). A simple adapter that sells for about $10 can let you convert your S-Video signal back into RCA if your TV lacks an S-Video plug. I play mine on an old CRT so I get the authentic look of the original games. This minor annoyance aside, this was a great buy that I still don't regret (though wish I had bought it on sale!).

As far as Genesis goes I couldn't be more pleased. Yeah, it's too bad about the Justifier, and I haven't tested the 32X (It's supposed to work) or the Sega (version 2, which works with both sega and EA games unlike the original team player) 4 player adapter (it's supposed to work), but the game genies for all 3 systems work fine. Overall this is great because it seemed like for years these console makers and emulators couldn't get the Genesis right. I heard reports of other systems and tv games out there that played too fast, or dropped frames or the sound was off. These seem perfect to me and I should know as Genesis was my system growing up. Maybe some obscure games won't work properly, or some peripherals out there might have problems, but my collection runs great.

I also love how you can plug in the NES zapper and play duck hunt (if you have a CRT tv, mind you, it won't work on LCD or LED). I have heard that Superscope 6 and the Sega Menacer work (since they worked with sensors much like the power glove or Nintendo Wii controllers) but I don't have them (and can't be bothered since they supported so few games and are expensive these days) and haven't tested.

If you're a real old school fan you probably have the real thing (100% perfect), and if you want to play original Famicom (Japanese family computer before the original NES) you probably should stick with that. I've heard there are problems with many PAL (European) versions of game cartridges on this, but the US and Japanese versions of Genesis and SNES should work perfectly. Back in the day we had to use the Game Genies to bypass some of the region security, but now you just plug the cartridge in and it works (Genesis games have a special switch on the front for the proper region, reset and adjust until you get to the one that you want). For somebody just starting out it's going to be expensive to get a library of games to play on. In that case you might be better off emulating stuff on your PC (since Retron5 is just a more expensive and glitchier way to do the same thing). I have a laptop and a tv adapter, and you can buy adapters that let you use original old school controllers (or you can buy innumerable usb clones of the retro controllers to simulate the original feel) and do pretty much the same thing and slightly better.

But if you're like me, and you played mostly US games for Genesis, SNES and NES, and still have 'em along with some controllers and other things, you'll be right at home with this and it saves space and electricity with very few differences from the original. It's cool to bring over to a friend's house with a box of games and spend an evening reliving some retro gaming fun.

In addition to the expansion cartridge (sold separately) that lets you play GBA games (I'll review it if I ever get it) there's also a converter out there that lets you play NES games on a SNES (unnecessary for this console), and I am pretty sure the ""Super Gameboy"" (a SNES cart that lets you play original gameplay games and one or two early gameboy color games on super nintendo on your tv) is compatible. I am pretty sure the powerbase converter (that lets you play Master System games on a sega genesis) also works if you can get that monster to fit on top of the system just right (haven't yet tried).

Another thing, if you were like me and got the previous (excellent) ""Retro Duo"" (which didn't play Genesis games yet) you'll notice the improved ""feel"" of the controllers, the comparable price, and the overall great job they did here. The little ""flip case"" that protects the control ports is a little annoying and the finish on the console is matte instead of glossy (like the Duo). I think Retrobit did a great job here. Not all of their creations are gold, but this is definitely the pinnacle of retro gaming consoles out there today, and worth it for the reasons I've stated. Don't waste your time on Retron5, get this instead (or go with pc emulation if that's your thing). I've heard tell that there's a new console out from retro-bit that's getting some bad reviews. Skip that one and come to this instead!",The Best Retro Gaming clone Console available today,1489276800,7,,

5.0,False,"05 2, 2014",A3TJJYF5Y5593Z,B0016GC9D8,dancinhomer,"Personally, I'm not a big RPG guy.  I couldn't get an hour into Oblivion or Dragon Age before I got bored.  That's simply a matter of taste.  My brother in law prefers games that are so complicated you have to take a night class at the local community college to get a handle on how to move your character.  And that's perfectly fine.

That being said, if you focus too much on the idea of this game being an RPG, you are probably going to be underwhelmed.  The customization of the main character is very limited.  The plot is largely linear, with the exception of dialog choices that affect how other characters regard you.  You have some skill trees to build on as you get experience points and you can emphasize whether you're a sneaky type or a ""I'VE BROUGHT HELL WITH ME!"" kind of ruffian.  You get the standard variety of firearms (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, SMG) that you can (and will need) to customize as you get the funds to do so, and that's about it.

So, if you want a game that gives you tons of options that will ultimately affect the gameplay... well, not so much.

But for me, that's about as complicated as I want it.  There are little hints in the intel that you gather that helps you know how to talk to certain people, but that's as far as I want to go.  Plop me down in a mission and let's DO THIS.

And when you are ""doing it,"" it's a lot of fun.  When I play this game, I find myself *thinking* like a spy.  I sneak around, hack computers, disable security systems and will almost always take a moment to crack a safe (all done through three different types of mini-games that are challenging without being tedious).  I'll sneak up on guys for a quick kill.  If they're too far away, I'll use my silenced assault rifle bullets to take 'em down.  And when things hit the fan, I'll break out my modified shotgun.

It's not ground-breaking.  The story isn't on a level of ""Heavy Rain,"" or even the ""Mass Effect"" trilogy.  The combat is duck and shoot, similar in mechanics to the Uncharted series or the aforementioned Mass Effect games.  But it's well-delivered.  The missions are very well thought out (at least, to me and my attention span).  And above all else, I had a blast playing it.

Considering the price, you can't go wrong.  It's not a run and gun FPS or RPG.  It's a third-person shooter with some storytelling elements and moderate customization.  It's not hard to pick up and the game does a great job encouraging you to build your skills.  All things considered, this is a must-have for anyone who enjoys a third-person shooter.","Light on the RPG, But a Dang Good Time",1398988800,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

The Bad: Not enough weapons, not enough creatures, it ends

Well, well, well EA finally pulls itself together. After this and the upcoming Mirror's Edge I think EA finally got some brains that were full of new IP and original content. Dead Space is a superbly gruesome and atmospherically terrifying game that goes above and beyond the call of duty (no pun intended) when it comes to atmosphere, story, and game play ideas. The story is really unique and it's been ages since a great new original story has blossomed in the horror genre. You are Isaac Clarke who is a repair man sent out to the Ishimura to find out why there is no communications on that ship. The ship is known as a ""Planetcracker"" and is carrying a mysterious relic called ""The Marker"" and Isaac finds everyone aboard dead and the place deserted...well except extremely creepy monsters, a couple crazy doctors, and his girlfriend...yeah its a superb story and it'll keep you hooked throughout, but won't really unfold until the last three levels.

Let's go right into game play; you can buy five different weapons (yeah this game NEEDED more weapons) they are the plasma cutter, ripper, flamethrower, force gun, and contact beam, and the line gun. They are all cool weapons yet there is a twist: They're TOOLS not guns. Isaac is a repair man, see, not a one-man-army mercenary or ex-military dude. This guy was NOT trained for combat and he must learn very quickly how to defend himself. This makes the game feel even more creepy and makes you feel more helpless since you have to make due with what you have. What I loved is that everything is displayed visually so there are no meters, bars, or gauges telling you your health and ammo. Everything is displayed on you. You have your health bar which is a bar on your suit, your stasis bar is on your back (more on stasis later), your ammo is displayed holographically when you're using your weapons and so is your flashlight.

Everything in the game is easily accessible and the controls are well mapped out. You can use melee combat by stomping on enemies or punching them. While you'll not want to do this since its a bit clunky it saves your butt in hairy situations. The way you kill enemies is by dismembering them to do extra damage. If you shoot their legs off they'll crawl to you, shoot their arms off and they bite you to death, shoot one arm and one leg off they'll still crawl to you, decapitate them and well they'll still try to kill you! If you get overwhelmed just use your stasis and slow them; this is a must do for some creatures like the Twitchers who run ultra fast. The creatures are very disturbing and are probably some of the most sick and twisted things created in a game I've EVER seen. These things are nasty and you just feel the pain when you realize these were all once humans (most of them). There are also lots of cinematic sequences like when a tentacle arm grabs your leg and it's dragging you down a hall while your trying to shoot it off. There are HUMONGOUS boss fights, some turret gun sections etc.

You'll NEVER get bored with the game since the scares vary so much. You'll walk down a hall and a guy will be petting his dismembered leg then fall over dead, you'll hear a nurse laugh hysterically and blow her brains out, people will be killed behind bullet proof glass etc. The game has a VERY disturbing atmosphere and you really do get scared with all of the amazing ambient sound effects that will keep you on the edge and make you jump constantly. Dead Space does everything differently from other horror games since its all so surreal because of the way its done. You really do feel abandoned on a ship that once was bustling with life. The graphics are also absolutely amazing; these are some of the best graphics seen so far and they are breathtaking. There's not much I can say except see it for yourself you'll be blown away!

There are segments that are zero gravity and vacuums. Zero gravity sections have you jumping around room solving puzzles and shooting things. These are very interesting and changes the pace a lot. When you enter a vacuum you are on an air timer and if you don't have any spare air can you're dead! You can upgrade everything via work benches by finding or buying power nodes. These work like ""trees"" where you have to fill a path to that upgrade with nodes. Each weapon has different upgrade specs and you won't be able to upgrade them all in one play through. In fact it'll take about two play throughs to get all achievements. There is plenty to do in the game and the achievements are not impossible to get (like in FEAR!!! or Burnout Revenge!!!) so don't panic.

All I have left to say is that Dead Space is absolutely amazing and I'd give it a higher score if there were more enemy types, more weapons, and just a bit more variety. There's enough to keep you interested through a couple of play throughs and I hope there will be a sequel (wait...it's EA of course there will be!!! Until we hate it...) There are six Dead Space comics available that you can pick up for about $15 for the lot. I HIGHLY suggest reading these since they fill you in about a few weeks before the game takes place. They have the same atmosphere and story telling as the game and they are a really good read.

I have always been a big fan of RPG games and fantasy, so this was a natural draw for me. Instead of the usual ""High Fantasy"" things like elves and orcs, though, this game takes place in a more dark-themed world. You'll be interacting with lots of spirits, demons, abominations, and vicious dragons.

The graphics are very nice. They don't have the kind of eye-popping radiance that you would see in Final Fantasy XIII-2, but instead are much more subtle. The game world is darkly beautiful. The graphics do a good job of creating a melancholy, forlorn, yet still attractive world. A lot of the textures are rather low-quality if you get very close to them, but there isn't anything really bad.

The character and enemy models are excellent. There is a lot more variety in the enemies you will face than in the Elder Scrolls games, like Skyrim. I feel that this game does a better job at making the enemies look and move in interesting ways. None of the animation looks stiff.

The sound, like the graphics, is nice but subtle. It sets the tone and fits the surroundings well, but it will never really intrude or make itself known well. The story is certainly present in the game, but it isn't quite as front-and-center as in a lot of RPGs. You are tasked with saving the Kingdom of Boletaria from a horde of demons. A lot of the story isn't even told to you directly. Rather, you just get glimpses of Boletaria's devastation. Piles of charred corpses, ruined castles, settlements infested with monsters.

I know a lot has already been said about the game's difficulty, so I won't linger too much on that. But it is a difficult game, though not quite as impossible as you may expect. There are lots of guides and hints on the internet now, too, in case you are really having trouble. Once you get used to all the controls and find a character type you like, the game really isn't so difficult. Though you will still get killed a lot, usually the first couple times you encounter a new boss or particularly powerful enemy.

Overall, I highly reccomend this game to any big fans of RPG games. You'll love it, unless the difficulty annoys you too much.","Excellent Action-RPG, Darkly Beautiful World",1383868800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"06 3, 2012",A1QA0FTTA4LPIP,B000LOAQNQ,Christina,"This is one of my favorite Final Fantasy games alongside 7, 8, 9, & 10. When it first came out, I thought it was a bit different. Later, not only did I realize it was a bit different, it was completely different from the originals. I didn't like it at first and had mixed feelings about it because it wasn't like the classics, but later I found that it has so many good qualities. The game's beautiful environments are vastly rich in land and your characters can move across the fields without having to go into another game mode. No, instead of setting up characters VS enemies like a chess match, you can attack freely when the attack gauge is full. Warning, the enemy can do it also. In this game, you'll know when you are going into battle. The blue and red lines appear over the character's heads,the enemy is literally attacking you, and the characters are in attack mode.

For battle, you use a series of gambits. A gamer can set them up themselves to see which way the characters react to the enemies or allies; its almost like having your very own AI making this game very fun to play. The characters can do what ever you want them to do out on the field as long as you have the right gambits. Your job is seeing if your characters are in trouble and need fleeing if the monsters are too strong. Mind you, this isn't near the paradigms on FF 13, so don't think you can sit and push the automatic button. This Final Fantasy is in fact very hard to beat if you don't train your characters. The gambits have their problems too. For an example, a character who is in-between performing a specific task might stop doing everything. For what ever reason it may be, sometimes the character may stop moving. So always check the gambits to see if they are specific. Later, you can get creative when you know what you're doing. Either this or you decide to go manual.

There are a couple things about this game that puts it on the same level as the playstation 1 Final Fantasy RPGs. The story takes place in Dalmasca, the same setting as FF Tactics the War of the Lions. The main character is about a orphan boy name Vaan who's older brother died in war from supposedly the man who murdered the King, Basch. The game pretty much does a good job of getting you addicted to the story-line in the prologue. Vaan hangs out with a girl named Penelo and they do jobs for a lizard type creature (forgot his name) found usually in the Sundaries place of Dalmasca.  The game reaches a climax when Balthier and Fran show themselves at the banquet. And the story-line spirals out of control when these two sky pirates find that Vaan has an item they want. This story is not like any other Final Fantasy up to date. This is the only FF game created by Square-Enix that is surprisingly fun!!!

Another thing is there are a lot of secrets hidden throughout the game and some of those may be discovered playing the second time around. The music is really beautiful and the story-line is alluring. The characters, depending on how you use the license board, can have some weapons, techniques, magic,defense, and mist attacks hidden all across the board. Just be careful on how you use the license board, it may be a bit difficult to new comers. You only get a certain amount of license points per battle. Another thing that is different is the summoning fiends. You'll find that the original names of the creatures in various parts of the FF series are only the name of ships in here. On this game, the summonings are known as Espers and they have some of the most unusual names. These names may be familiar to you if you've play Final Fantasy tactics the War of the Lions. Still these Espers have about the same elemental attack styles as the originals creatures.

With this being said, this is a game I recommend to any RPG player. Some may not like the way FF changed, but for this game, it is actually a good thing. If you really think about it, the game hasn't changed at all. Final Fantasy 12 is just another version of tactics the war of the lions. It has different characters, but the same time period. The only problem with this game is I feel there is more game-play than there is story. A lot cut scenes, but this doesn't become much of a bother considering the story-line is still understandable and highly convincing. The characters also all look the same in graphics during regular movie mode, they only look different when the graphics change to computer animated scenes. You'll find if you look closely at the characters, they have a white dot on their face underneath their eye on the cheek (Strange?).But despite all of those minor things, this game is an excellent part to the series. And it is a well worth play, over and over again.",Addictive!!!,1338681600,,,

Even though the graphics were improved, the gameplay was dissaproved. The gameplay was trumendously bad. The was because the Sid Meider did not make the game. Sid came back, and made the next civilization.
Civilization 3 is a cross between Civ 2 and Civ: Call to Power. It has the great gameplay of civ 2 and the good graphics of Call to Power. This is why I recommend the game to everyone.
Newbies, if you have no idea what i am talking about, here is a review for Newbies:
Civilization 3 is, i think, the best game to start out with. Civ 3 has some better menu commands, and it comes with a civ dictionary, so u can find out every term that may come to use with you. Don't be scared of the 300 page instruction manual. You don't need it. If you want to read it, it will give you a lot of background knowledge. If not, just play the tutorial.

For those that remember it this game instantly reminded me of Jet Set Radio. Good thing is also has Ratchet and Clank plus Crackdown mixed in. It is also an entertaining light hearted story. Which was a good change from playing Destiny/Diablo.

The graphics are also really impressive. Just looking at the screen I cant say it is the best looking game of this generation. To me the winner of that currently is Forza Horizon 2. The amount of action going on though is the high point. There is no game that has this much going on at one time. There was a lot of zombies in Dead Rising but they did not move much.

5.0,False,"10 20, 2011",A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B0016G88RO,Jeff Johnson,"This game calls itself a 3rd person espianage RPG shooter. It is also dirt cheap which is why you should buy it now. But for the tough sale out there, I'd like to cover what the game excels at and what it doesn't.

The biggest reason why everyone should play this game is that it really revolves around you. No not your character Mike Thorton (rogue agent for Alpha Protocol), but you the player. There are interactive cut scenes that you pick where the conversation goes. Not just that but your choices in the conversation will improve or decline your reputation with characters in the game. The story becomes your own. You can execute characters, be hostile toward them, nice, suave, and a lot of other things to each one. Your alliances build and fall apart and make other characters like or hate you more. It is really captivating. Their animations are realistic, they don't just stand there... unless they're on a television screen, but even then effects spice it up.

The talks are good and well written especially for the diversity. The voice acting is very believable and some characters like the Russians are a little cheesy. Perhaps intentionally cheesy like the 80s mobster and the agent sent to murder you (Darcy).

You will get emails from these characters and you can reply to them using preset emails that will change your relationship with them accordingly. You will also meet a journalist too and whenever you find out dirty little secrets, you can send it to her, sell it on the black market or notify the company you have the secret.

The story is that you are Mike Thorton, the newest agent at Alpha Protocol. You are sent off to find missiles that were used by terrorists to shoot down a passenger jet. You get sent through 4+ different parts of the world (Rome and Moscow come to mind) on dozens of missions that have a good deal of variety to them. Most missions are your standard find this and rescue that.

The game also excels with its mini games, such as lock picking where you simply match the lock tumblers, computer hacking where you need to match 2 strings of letters to a series of other letters and finally a find the path electronic wires sort of thing. All of these are done amazingly well and keep your mind thinking and your eyes looking. It is another captivating part of the game.

There are 4 varieties of weapons. Pistols, shotguns, assault rifles and sub machine guns. Each handles differently and there are several different weapons in each category. At the end of each mission you will get a level up and you can choose your stats for abilities like pistol usage, shotgun usage, martial arts, electronics, stealth and so on. With each level you get to, there are new specials that will be unlocked. Such as room clear for shotguns and slow motion for pistols. They are very nice abilities that will take the guess work out of RPGing. You have secondary items too like first aide, flash bangs, grenades, decoys, sound generators and so on.

Now let's talk about the bad part of the game. Well bad in relative terms. If you've played 3PS games... then you've played BETTER 3PS games. Its also an RPG game which means if you shotgun someone in the head at point blank... you still might miss them! All because the accuracy of your weapon isn't high enough and that's your random luck.

The boss battles can be extremely frustrating if you don't have special abilities. Luckily there are not that many boss battles, but the ones against humans are the most frustrating just because they can take 100 shotguns to the face and still kill you.

This is a cover based shooter, but honestly I don't find myself using it much. I just go in very rambo style. When I shoot someone down I just run up to them and finish them off. That's my play style. There is stealth and stealth kills. People also don't seem to like the camera either because your mouse moves the camera... but if you hold the right mouse button that takes on a traditional 3PS or OTS look so you can accurately shoot.

The game has some nice enemy animations. Shoot someone and they will act realistically. They fall to the floor, fly through the air, flip if you shoot their leg, their gun will go off and other interesting things. The AI isn't exactly smart though. No one scatters from cover if you throw a grenade. Enemies will charge at you if they run out of ammo or if they're close enough. That will stun you. Enemies will throw grenades to get you to move. The graphics aren't the best, but the environments feel real and believable with nothing glaringly bad.

In all this is a really fun game and very immersive. I never want to stop playing it, because I always want to see what's next.",Captivating 3PS RPG that plays to what you choose for a cheap price,1319068800,2,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Pro

1080p/60fps - One thing I was worried about when Doom was shown off at E3 2015 was weather the game will still look and run good, After all we all remember what happen with games like Watch Dogs,Assassin Creed Unity and who can forget Alien Colonial Marines. After playing the game for the last couple of days I can finally say id software was true to there words. Not only does the game look good but it actually runs at 1080p at 60fps. Finally a game that runs at 1080p at 60fps that isn't a remaster (not that there anything wrong with remasters games I just fell that there so much remakes out there that its being overused).

Solid campaign - One thing Doom is know for is it strong single player mode and that continues with 2016 version of Doom. The game will take you about 13 hours to complete however it might take you longer depending what difficulty you pick (good luck with Nightmare & Ultra-Nightmare your going to need the patients for that one) and how much time you are willing to find the hidden secrets in each level.

SnapMap Mode - Similar to last year Mario Maker on the WIIU (though not the same both games do have there similarities) SnapMap mode allow you to make your own level and upload it on the internet for others people to try. If your into that kind of stuff then give SnapMap a try.

Cons

Ok Multiplayer & Season Pass- While the Multiplayer mode is fun (not to mention fast pace as well) its nothing really special. Most of mode are pretty much the same you get in other shooters games as well (like king of the hill and death match are 2 good example) and while there is a season pass for Doom. Its just for the multiplayer so unless multiplayer is your thing to me its not worth getting.

Weapon selection - While you can switch between the last 2 weapons you used (or opening up your weapon wheel selection) I find it odd that you cant assigned your to the D-pad. I mean for a game that all about being fast pace and not being a cover base shooter you would think the developers would give you the option to assigned up to 4 weapons to the D-Pad that way you don't have to open the weapon every single time.

Lack of Story - While there is a story in Doom (through data logs) I do (and Im fully aware not everyone will agree with me on this) find it a bit disappointing that the story is put on the wayside. This is an issue I had with 2011 release of Rage. It had solid gameplay and a great universe to explore but I felt the story could have been fleshed out a bit more.

Not for COD & Halo fan - If your going into this game expecting this to play like COD or Halo then youll in for a whirlwind of disappointing. Doom is not like that. Doom is all about fighting Demons, finding secrets & hidden rooms, having to find health pack (you don't have rechargeable health) and its one big selling point being gory and violent and fun. So if you are not of fan of any of that then Doom isn't for you then.

Overall -For me Doom is a blast to play. While there are some things I don't agree with (like the weapon wheel & lack of story) it doesnt prevent me from enjoying it. Being that this is a reboot I do hope it does well so we can get a sequel though.",The grandaddy of all FPS returns,1463702400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Now, this is a VERY, VERY, AWESOME game!!!!! I have been playing it for a week now and I cannot wait to get off work to get my hand on that amazing piece of art we call Motor Storm Pacific Rift!

From boot you will notice that the game has a very crisp sound accompanied by a deep bass as the icons flash with logos. The opening movie is very intense with breath taking visual and sick music!! One thing you will notice right away if you have played the old MS (MotorStorm) is that the menu system is super quick and easy to navigate, the first MS had a very slow menu system but still had stellar game play.

The game allow to play single player, multi player, and split screen (cool thing is you can choose the screen layout of how the screen will split with two players, i.e. vertical or horizontal.) Single player is the meat of the game and its sick!!!! You pick 1 outta 4 classes (EARTH, AIR, LAVA, and WATER) each landscape is based around its title. Then you can pick tickets each with there own challenge such as race, speed (time trial), eliminator, etc... some ticket will only allow certain vehicles.  When picking your motor of destruction you will want to take into account traction, speed, boost, acceleration, strength, and terrain. Each vehicle will react differently to each terrain. Motorcycles and quads are quick and boost well but need to stay high and dry because mud and water will slow them down. Buggies, rally cars and racing trucks are the medium. Mud pluggers, Big rigs, and Monster trucks are the heavy duty guys who can deal damage and play well in mud and deep water. Each motor with have choices of body styles and paint jobs, nothing really in depth but it feels nice to change things up a bit.

Game play- NOW THIS IS THE FUN PART!!!!

When you begin to play will most likely be stunned by the gorgeous scenery and perfect detail on every object. Before you know it your still sitting at the starting line drooling on your controller. BUT if you can get up and go with the rest you will have a fierce battle on you hands. Other opponents will taunt you as the ram your motor and you will come to ridiculously close-near death crashes as you try and avoid obstacles such as building, trees, cliff edges, barriers, etc... The game will give you a boost option in about 10- 15 seconds into the race which can really help if you use it wisely. Squeeze off some juice and your motor will haul some serious arse. Too much boost and you will explode your engine and may takeout other racers (not bad). The game moves super smooth with 60 fps and not pop-in or screen tearing. Perfect collision rendering and truly amazing car pile ups. If you see something in the game you want to remember, you can simply pause the game and select photo mode and begin to snap away as you steal some perfect moments for this sick mind bending game. All photos you take can be stored on the games data or can be exported out to your ps3's photo location. This game will take you through some down right bad azz locals such as sunny beach sides to treacherous volcanic mountain tops.

I can ramble on and on but I won't because I get off work in about 30 mins so I will be playing this game very soon.

Once again Sony and Evolution Studios has made another Heart pounding, sick metal tearing, jaw dropping thrill ride of a game!!!

5.0,False,"12 6, 2014",A36NMMVWY6BP1V,B002BSC54I,evani1997,"Exclusively on Wii, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword has quickly become my favorite Zelda game and one of my favorite games of all time. Its use of the Wii Motion Plus creates the most realistic swordplay found in gaming so far, and the beauty of the game makes it one of the most memorable games ever made.

Its story, when compared to other Zelda games, is fairly simple. Before people lived in the land of Hyrule, they lived on a floating island called Skyloft. Link, a young swordsman, is thrust into an adventure that takes him to the ground when his best friend Zelda is kidnapped by a monster called Demise. Essentially, it's a boy-saves-girl story. However, the execution is great. No other Zelda game features as much personality or heart as this one, and the cinematics are very movie-like.

The gameplay is a major improvement on the previous Zelda games. For the first time ever, sword fighting feels realistic and makes you feel like you're really in an adventure. The Wii Motion Plus allows you to experience combat far superior to Twilight Princess's vague sword fighting. Though it's true that the Motion Plus needs to be calibrated every once in a while, the overall mechanics work very well.

Not only are the fights better, but so are most of the dungeons. Though the game starts with fairly simple dungeons, the second half features ridiculously creative dungeons. The game also features a decent difficulty. Unlike previous Zelda games that tend to have at least one totally unfair part (*cough* Wind Waker's Triforce hunt *cough*), Skyward Sword feels fair on almost all grounds. Any time it does feel too difficult, your assistant Fi (one of the only helpful assistant characters in a Zelda game) will likely be able to give you decent hints. If she doesn't help much, you can always go to a Sheikah Stone and ask it.

A few other additions to the game also help make it more fun. One that should have been included a long time ago is the dash (activated by holding the A button). For the first time in a Zelda game, Link can actually sprint. This cuts running through fields and climbing up things by half. Another, which is one of my personal favorites, is the upgrade shop. Now your inventory of items can be upgraded. Bows can shoot faster, shields can be stronger, and slingshots can fire more pellets at once. The upgrade shop adds a certain RPG-like element to the game, which I think is a total plus.

In terms of presentation, Skyward Sword continues the Zelda legacy by having great graphics and music. Its art style is very much like a painting, where everything is colorful and stylized. This graphic style works very well with this game and doesn't feature as many blemishes as games like Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time (though it should be noted that they do feature some ugly spots). The music is done by a live orchestra and is very memorable. Like many other Zelda games before it, Skyward Sword features a soundtrack that is sure to get stuck in your head (in a good way!). Though the real orchestra doesn't change the sound too much, the songs themselves are great.

There are a couple of things I'm not too fond with- both of them involve repetition. Whenever you find an item (such as a bug or a feather), the game gives you a brief description, even if you've collected it multiple times before. The other problem is that Fi (as useful as she generally is) will consistently remind you that your health is low whenever you have around three or less hearts. Other than those two problems, the game is amazing.

As a whole, Skyward Sword is probably the highest-quality Zelda game yet. Even though the plot isn't as deep as games like Twilight Princess or The Wind Waker, the emotional weight and character development make this game stand out in terms of its story. Combine its heart with its excellent gameplay and beautiful presentation and you've got what I consider to be the best Zelda game currently available. This game is a definite must-play for any gamer out there.

5.0,False,"09 26, 2005",A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0007OGDHS,Terry Mesnard,"There have been games throughout the years that have truly done something original, different and completely engaging.  It always seems to be that these games fall by the wayside in terms of popularity which is a shame.  Indigo Prophecy falls into this category as an original game with a fantastic premise and incredibly exciting gameplay.

Never before have I played a game that was so interactive in its story-telling.  When trying to describe this game, I would point to God of War, a PS2 game in which there were scenes where you have timed button presses that would move forward a cutscene.  It helped bring you into the story, the cutscenes so that it was you that were doing all of the cool acrobatic manuevers killing the hydra.  Another game that used this to a lesser effect was Resident Evil 4, for example with the knife fight that you had to push buttons to keep Leon safe.  Indigo Prophecy takes this idea and pushes it to the extreme.

IP is basically and incredibly interactive movie.  It mixes the adventure genre, which is seldom seen on console, and movies and melds them into a cohesive and incredibly engaging story.  It starts off with a bang as you immediately find yourself killing someone you don't know in a diner.  You feel like you're not in control of your actions and as a result you have a body in a restroom and a policeman drinking coffee in the restaurant.  What do you do?  You're free to act from here on out.  Do you leave the body and rush out?  Do you hide the body?  What about the blood?  What about the blood on you?  What about the knife?  When you leave do you pay your bill?  You can take care of all or none of the options above.  And the story will be different, sometimes marginally sometimes drastically.  Oh, and by the way, that cop sitting outside needs to use the restroom and soon the screen will split and you better be out of there before he makes it to the restroom.

This opening sequence exemplifies everything this game is about.  Choices, story and gameplay all merged into one.  But innovation doesn't end there.  As soon as Lucas (the murdering protagonist) is free of the diner, you take control of two police detectives who investigate the scene.  You can switch between the two on the fly and you have to find clues, make theories and basically do everything in your power to catch Lucas.  Its this give and take gameplay, where you have to play one side against the other, that truly gives the game a sense of urgency and excitement.

Going back to the God of War example, when you have cutscenes in this game, you better not put your controller down.  Gameplay pushes forward the story-centered bits as well.  Whether its doing a simon says type control scheme to manuever your character past cars that are hurtling toward him, alternating between the L and R trigger as fast as you can to save someone who's drowning or using the R stick to make dialogue choices on the fly (you're timed) to hear all you can, the game makes sure to bring you into the story.  Its very effective and really ratchets up the tension.

If there is one sore spot in the game its the graphics.  While not bad, exactly, they don't necessarily push the Xbox in the way that this last year of Xbox life should.  It looks like a first or possibly second generation Xbox game.  Artistically the game is good.  The characters in the cutscenes move really well and realistically.  And there is never a moment of lag or skipping seen in a lot of games today.  The character's faces have some nice emotion to them and the graphics aren't stellar, like I said, but they do a decent job.  There's a ton of aliasing, however, which is sad.

Another sore spot is the controls.  When you are in direct control of your character (i.e. actually moving them as opposed to having control of the cutscenes via button pressing) the game is pretty loose.  It reminds me of playing the old Resident Evil games.  You have the cinematic camera which causes some confusion as to which direction you should push your character.  As a result, you will do a lot of figure 8s in the game which can cause a lot of problems when you have to hide the evidence because a cop is at your door and the timer is going down.  Character animation while moving is also very stiff and a big difference from the cut scene animation.

The audio is terrific, however.  While the box says the game does not run in 5.1 in game, I think it lies.  My receiver lights up whenever 5.1 is being used and its always lit with this game.  And it sounds like 5.1 is being used.  The voice acting is absolutely wonderful and professional.  Each voice matches the character and it helps enhance this feeling of playing a murder mystery movie.  With voice acting becoming so important in games today, this is most welcome and really helps sell the game.  Musically, the game also excels by using the very talented Angelo Badalamenti to score it.  That name might not mean much on the outset but he has created scores to many Hollywood movies including most by David Lynch (Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr., Twin Peaks) but also Dark Water, Arlington Road, etc.  The score is absolutely beautiful and moving; it really fits in with what is happening on screen.

What this game does best is meld the story-telling of a movie with the gameplay of video games.

With all of the games out for the holiday season, Spiderman Web of Shadows may fall off your radar. I have previously played part 3 and 2 of spiderman and I didn't like them, but when I saw the video of the combat of this one on XBOX Live I thought I may give it a shot. I am glad I did, in this game you really feel like Spiderman, I just completed PT 2 of the story and I have a lot of Air Combos, special moves and assistance Characters. The coolest part about this game is the new fighting system, it makes the game very enjoyable. You can fight most enemies entirely in the air once you level up. You can become evil or good at different points throughout the game and that determines which characters assist you as well as the ending (guessing) but you can still switch between the standard (good guy) red and blue and the(evil) black costumes at will, and even mid combo, which makes for some pretty interesting gameplay once you master the game (your friends will be impressed). The helper characters, which I won't spoil for you, will stay on screen so long as you keep fighting and your special meter stays full.

  Overall this is a good sandbox game and there are plently of those on the XBOX 360 to choose from such as GTAIV, Hulk, God Father and etc. I have played most of these games but this is the only one of these types of games that have held my interest long enough to the point that I am on the verge of beating it. The rest of these games, although good games, gets either extremely difficult (I hate the motorcycle chase in GTAIV) or I just lose interest. I didn't find anything too negative about this game except for the graphics could have been a little better, and sometimes the camera angle gets weird when you transition from wall running, to web swinging or walking on the ground, other than that I would definitly recommend this game.","Surprised, They got it right!",1225152000,4,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

First, the basics. You are a young martial arts student who is sent by your master on a quest, in a fictional Oriental land. As you move through this world, you encounter a wide variety of people and situations. The choices you make help to shape the world around you and your skill progression.

The graphics are simply *beautiful* to look at. Each area has its own look, and the details are just stunning. There have been other XBox games in the past that looked quite nice, but with Jade Empire I really think they've hit the top. We'll have to wait for the next XBox to see anything more lush than this.

The sounds show that same attention to detail. The voice actors are great, and the background sounds really shine. The soundtrack is well done, too. The developers poured a lot of energy into the sound atmosphere in which you explore, and it really shows.

Gameplay is very smooth and fun. You can balance three different aspects of your ""health"" - i.e. physical health, magic power and focus - through your choices in combat. There are a wide variety of styles, and certain enemies are resistant to certain styles of attacks.

There is a main plot line, and numerous side plots. Sure, if you have a walkthrough, you can zip through the game in only 15 or so hours. That's true for pretty much any game. The joy of an RPG is to take your time, explore, talk to people. It's the difference between fast-forwarding through a DVD to see the end, vs actually sitting back and enjoying the entire ride. Compared to how much money you pay for a 1.5 hr movie, you're getting an incredible bargain here!

""Resident Evil"" came breaking through the barriers of video gaming.  All that was wrong with video games was in ""Resident Evil.""  Then, the franchise grew.  And so did the number of video game systems.  2002, ""Resident Evil"" came back, full force.  With graphics to make Stevie Wonder do a double take, you realize you ARE part of the game.  Perhaps it isn't you that owns the game... maybe the game owns you.  I dunno, but it's very interesting.  The Bravo team of S.T.A.R.S. has a chopper down in a remote mountain region outside of Raccoon City, where ""strange happenings"" have been taking place over a time of about two weeks, I believe.  Well, they send in the Alpha team, which consists of Jill Valentine (My very favorite), Chris Redfield, Barry, Wesker, Brad ""Chickenheart"" Vickers, and some guy that gets killed in the beginning.  Well, zombie dogs attack and Brad (the pilot) flies off in fear, leaving you and your teamates to fend for yourselves.  Well, to make a long story short, Hell ensues.  Let me break down the schematics for ya!

  Graphics- 10/5.  Holy ish!  Could that corpse not look anymore real?  All I have to say is that it feels as if you are playing a movie, or controling real life.  If only other video games could mirror this.  It has perfect graphics.  They are beautiful, haunting, and, as I've said, very real.  The lighting is spooky.

  Sound- 10/5, again.  From hearing leaves crunch in the distance to hearing the soft moan of a zombie at the end of the hall, the sound is crisp, very clear, and freaky.

  Controls- 4/5.  Not above average like the graphics/sound, it gets very annoying trying to remember what button runs, what button triggers the inventory, what button changes targets.  It's nostalgic, to say the least.  But. they do say half the fun is in getting there!

  Horror- 10/5.  It is the scarriest game to have ever graced any system.  It's a test to try to play this game with the lights off.  Capcom truely knew what they were doing when they decided to remake a game that was, at best, laughable back in the day.  Be afraid.  Be very afraid.

  Overall- 100/5.  This is a must own for ""Resident Evil"" fan to ""Gamecube owner whose never heard of the series before"" alike.  It's enough to make Helen Keller smile.

This is exactly what the box art says it is. You get hot babes wearing little clothing armed with katanas ready to slice everything on their path (mostly zombies). The controls are good for a Wii motion control exclusive, it only uses the speed sensors so no crazy aiming issues here, you just need to shake the wiimote most of the time the nunchuck serves as secondary attack to break enemies defense or for the dual blade control which is very intense cause requires both controls to move at the same time. There are three game modes, Story, Free mode and Survival, the story mode is very short about two hours long for each character and there's 4 characters total, but in this game the story feels more like beating an arcade mode in fighting games, it becomes more challenging as you unlock harder difficulties and also beating story chapters opens them for free mode and you need to play free mode to unlock achievements, here they call it ""Quests"" but they aren't quests. And the main purpose of quests is to unlock new costumes.
And finally characters gain experience points from killing enemies so it feels like a weird mix of action, beat em up and RPG, I really can't compare it with any other games I've played maybe is somewhat similar to Sengoku Basara or Samurai Warriors, so if you like those I'd recommend you give this a try if you're hunting for Wii-exclusive hidden gems.",Good Game.,1479513600,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

Nintendo's previous controller, from the Nintendo 64, was good, but not great. It was a very different type of design. The GameCube controller is a million times better than that controller. It's really hard to believe. The very first time I held this controller in my hands, I knew it was a winner.
  Many people say this controller was made for people with small hands. I disagree with that. I have small hands myself, but I have a few friends who have huge hands, and they have no problems with it. The left and right triggers are in the perfect position for both of your index fingers. All the buttons on the right side of the controller are easily accessible with your right thumb. They button layout is nearly perfect; with an enlarged ""A"" button for games with repetitive pressing of a single button. The analog stick can be easily accessed with your left thumb, and it rotates smoothly every time. The C-stick has replaced the C buttons from the previous N64 controller, and it allows for much more precise control.
  The only problems I could possibly think of with this controller are that the control pad is a bit small, but it is very rarely used, so that really isn't too big of a problem and the second thing I could think of was that the length of the controller cable is a bit short, but that can be easily fixed with extension cables. And now that the WaveBird is out, you can enjoy the wonderful GameCube controller without all the trouble of cables!
  I've had this controller for nearly eight months now, and it is still extremely dependable. All the buttons are still firm, and the control stick is still nice and tight. Nintendo hardly needs to issue any kind of a warrantee with this controller; there is hardly any chance of anything bad happening to it.  You would have to drop something heavy on it, or pour something on it.  I've dropped my controller numerous times, and nothing has happened to it yet.  It is still in nearly brand new factory specifications. I am truly amazed.
  Overall, this controller is better than any of its counterparts. It deserves the ""best controller"" award in my book. Nintendo has come up with another masterpiece.

Sure, we have Zelda, or Metroid Prime 3, but the plumber was missing, until now. I honestly did not have too much interest in the game, but when my brother told me that he bought it, I thought ""Sure, let's try it."" Now, I can safely say that this is one of the most innovative games I have played in a while. Sure, it plays pretty much like Mario 64 and Sunshine. It has the basic Mario plot and premise, but there are certain qualities about it that make it that much better. The level design is outstanding, for example. No two galaxies will be the same, and each one has many different ways of completing. The graphics are hands-down the best on the Wii. Colorful and richly detailed, there is barely any slow-down of the frame rate. The one thing that really bought me was the music. When I began to play in the ""Good egg galaxy"", I literally got goosebumps. I LOVED the music in the game. The story felt even bigger and epic thanks to the music, and it's almost the same as other Mario games, minus the Luma and their Mom story arc. The gameplay was satisfying, specially those hard platforming levels which used the Mario Bros. 3 music. Nostalgia, let me tell you.

Hey, I apologize in advance for the super-long review but this is an immense game so maybe it deserves a long review. I'll see if I can abbreviate it a little but I'm afraid it will stay 'long' no matter what I do.

Hmmm... I worked so hard to bring my beloved Uchigatana to a +6 but now Ben, Bladwin's brother - they are both blacksmiths - suggests that I give it to him and he's going to make a Crescent Uchigatana +1 out of it. A PLUS ONE out of my +6? Yes, my kids advise, go for it. While it's true that the Plus One Crescent does only 75 damage vs. my +6's 153, my current level of magic 35 should add at least 92 points of magic attack to the physical damage and, with the help of a few dozen Darkmoon stones (lots of Grim Reapers had to die for me to harvest them) and less than 10,000 souls (a bargain) I can immediately upgrade it to Crescent +3 and with THAT weapon, my friends, it only takes one quick slash to dispose of a silver skeleton and I can do away more than half a dozen low-level zombies with one swing. And, did I mention that it will slowly restore my MP (magic points) while I'm wearing it so I don't really need to keep the Fragrant Ring on and I could use the Sharp Magic ring instead to further boosts my magic strengths including Uchigatana's power but, true, it WILL lower my magic defenses. Or use the Thieves' Ring while in Queen's Tower prison so that the lovely bell-ringing octopus-head prison guards (good looking girls with a passion for electrocuting and stabbing while hugging you tight) won't notice me. And the Thieves' Ring seems to do well with those giant flying stingrays. They do notice me eventually but it makes them less vigilant so there are fewer of those 15-foot long, self-homing spikes they keep shooting at me when they get angry or suspicious.

Did I say too much? Then, let me say this. Granted, I'm a slow player because I really like to enjoy my games so maybe this is not typical but, after some 400 hours of play, Yesssss... got my Platinum - my only so far and, until maybe until Elder Scrolls V comes around, likely to stay this way.

BRIEFLY

Demon's Souls is, in my view, one of the best fantasy RPGs that ever came to a game console. If you don't mind stabbing, slashing, shooting, cleaving, crushing, tearing, punching, scratching, infecting, slicing, burning or poisoning your enemies (and have the same thing done to you) and watching them die as they bleed, scream, decompose and sometimes howl  in agony or even beg for mercy. And you'll be facing several classes of zombies, gargoyles, giant flying stingrays, knights in shining or all-black armors swinging what you could safely call 'weapons of mass destrctions' in the shape of ten-foot long meat cleavers at you, leeches, rats, blobs with shields on top of them, daemons of all shapes an sizes, grim rippers, octopus-headed ladies, immensely powerful fire-breathing dragons, giant steel spiders, huge worms with human faces.

Coming from someone who's played the Ultima series way back in the 80's and who's still waiting for the next in the Scrolls of the Elders, having enjoyed Oblivion more than any other console RPG, saying that Demon's Souls is 'awesome' should mean something. But, I was trying to briefly describe the game so, here it is, the story line in a paragraph, as dark and impossibly complicated as it could possibly come out of Japan. A king attempts to keep his kingdom - Boletaria - prosperous by means of some dark rituals involving the consumption of souls which, eventually, awakens the Old One, a great demon whose awakening unleashes lesser but still immensely powerful demons who quickly begin feasting on the regular people souls themselves while the kingdom is enveloped by a mysterious fog, isolating it from the rest of the world. None but one who went into the fog ever returned and that one told the story - everyone in Boletaria is now insane and, unless someone does something, the fog is likely to spread and envelop the entire world. And that's where you, the player, get involved so your mission is to talk the Old One into going back to sleep and maybe save the world.

MY EVALUATION

It's strange how a game that's so unforgiving and that requires you to fight so many battles again and again until you achieve perfection - only to have to fight them some more - can become so addictive and almost obsessively so. There are three gamers in our family and not only do we wait for our turns but we watch each other playing, share 'funny stories' and tips involving gameplay and lose a lot of sleep when we can afford it and sometimes when we can't. It's probably illogical but, having to fight the same battles many times is not only immersive but it's actually fun and rewarding. On the third or fourth try you know exactly how to defeat the Grim Reaper and you know each individual Gargoyle's style and capabilities and you can play each battle in many different ways by slightly changing your tactics and strategies and the weapons you use until you achieve the perfect stab or slash or cast your spell at the time and place needed for it to hit the mark and to maximum damage. The only thing... before you get to the Grim Reaper you must first annihilate a few dozen other enemies, every single time.

And did I mention that that worlds of Boletaria are simply Awesome? Exploration and discovery are a joy in this game only balanced by the overwhelming sense of fear, dread and desolation oozing out of it. Most of your enemies don't only die when you dispose of them, but they go screaming, screeching or howling. Their bodies bleed and, through the controller, you can almost feel the the flesh tearing apart or stabbed by your blade or their armor breaking into pieces.

Being so hard to master - but not impossible because I won't consider myself a great player - there is a great sense of accomplishment every time a new boss is defeated, a weapon is upgraded and tried out in the field or a new location is conquered.

I can't give too much praise to the online play elements. You are NEVER alone in Demon's Souls. Other players can watch you and you can see their ghostly outlines as they play. You can leave messages to warn others of dangers and... you can see how they die or sometimes commit suicide. You can help others and sometimes you must defend yourself from those attempting to invade your world and destroy you. And all is smooth and so well integrated into the game's atmosphere that, in the rare occasions when our PS3 loses its network, all seems disturbingly quiet and lonely.

While nothing is perfect and nothing can be perfect and without having finished the game yet, I would say that Demon's Souls is without a doubt a top RPG for the PS3 platform.

GAMESPACE

You act in 5 'worlds' or locations:  the Boletarian Palace, the Stonefang Tunnel, the Tower of Latria, the Shrine of Storms and the Valley of Defilement and you can cross from one world into another via the Nexus, a safe space, to the extent that anything built on top of the Old One can be safe, where you do most housekeeping chores. You can move relatively freely inside each world to the extent that you don't mind fighting... everybody all the time and there are gates that take you farther (usually deeper) into the worlds IF you manage to defeat the bosses guarding them.

Along the way, and usually following a fight, you find weapons and armor or items that may help you upgrade your weapons or armor and you decide how to manage your possessions but the main currency in the worlds of Boletaria is now 'souls'. Everyone is after them and the only way you can survive is to get them, usually by killing your opponents and to spend them on things that you need.

But this is only scratching the surface. Your eventual goal is to calm down the Old One by defeating and killing the demons that feed him souls and, as expected, this is not exactly a walk in the woods. How about a walk in swamps infested by some of the most foul and poisonous or disease spreading critters you could never imagine? Or exploring deep and dark tunnels where ghosts and Grim Reapers live, or some immense prison where all have lost their minds and the warden ladies wear tentacles on their heads? Or a mine where... you guessed it right, everyone is insane and they keep acting as if they were working but they will always take a break so that they can chase you around, throw some fireballs at you or drop boulders the size of trucks on you? And if you think that the 'surface' is safer, think huge dragons capable of completely incinerating you with one casual sneeze, or flying stingrays shooting giant ice spears or armored and well-armed skeletons always in a bad mood.

GAMEPLAY

After you create your character - name, gender, class, looks - you start with very little but, as you gather souls, you pay the blind lady who doesn't look like much but almost everything here is deceiving and she will raise your soul level, allowing you to improve on ability: vitality, endurance, strength, intelligence, magic, faith, dexterity, luck and you will need these abilities to be able to cast spells use certain weapons and generally survive in a world in which there are very few you could call 'friends'.

You progress by improving yourself and your weapons and defeating the various bosses. Doing so is important because the bosses block access to areas where... the next boss can be found.

Once you get killed, something that happens often, you lose the souls that you accumulated and wake up in the Nexus in 'soul form'. And there are ways to regain your body, usually by defeating a boss or... HELPING someone else defeat a boss but acting in human form must be a well-thought decisions. You do have more 'health points' as a 'body' but you are also weaker and while in a body form your world is open to invasion from other players out there. They can show up and kill you and, every time you die (or when you do bad things) the world you died in turns a little 'darker'. And the darker the world, the tougher your opponents become and... you are more likely to find 'good stuff'.

While in 'soul' form, you can volunteer to help other players defeat bosses or simply ride along with them. The reward is that you are revived in body form if, when summoned, you help the other player defeat a boss or maybe defeat an invader who teleported into his world to kill him.

Now, just to make it all a lot more fun, while you are online, the makers of Demon's Souls have the ability to control the so-called 'world tendency' in each of the five worlds, independently of your own actions so a pure-white world may suddenly turn darker and more dangerous or vice-versa.

And this is not all. While playing, you can see the 'blood stains' of the heroes who died on that particular spot. You touch it and you see the last seconds that preceded that hero's death. And you can leave messages to warn others and, you can see in real time, the ghostly images of other players fighting monsters or just running around as you are minding your own business.

And, of course, every time you leave a world for the safety of the Nexus, ALMOST everything other than the bosses and some of the NPCs resets and respawns. So you will be fighting the same battles over and over and over again, using different tactocs, improving your skills until you approach perfection and achieve elegance.

And... how about whole the game resetting itself? It's true, or so I heard that, after you complete the game you can retain some of your hard-earned possessions and skills and go for an 'encore' but a bit harder this time.

THE PAIN FACTOR

This is one of the most brutal and unforgiving games I've ever played. And I'm not talking about the slaying of zombies or slimy creatures at almost every turn and having to do it repeatedly. Demon's Souls is unforgiving to the player because nothing but complete dedication and near-perfection would do.

The tutorial is probably the threshold that's the hardest to cross. You start weak and almost unarmed and you mission is not only to survive - which, if you are successful, you won't - but also to defeat a mysterious monster that's almost nothing but slime, near-impenetrable armor and dozens of extra-long spears and do it in near-complete darkness. Saying that it's frustrating it's an understatement. I would have given up if it weren't for my kids who won their first victory before I did and motivated me to continue.

And the hardship continues and only grows after that. Unlike most other games, you can't just save once you defeat an opponent and establish a safe point to restart from. You are in that world until you are killed and lose your hard-earned souls or you return to the Nexus on your own but, remember, every time you come back from the Nexus, all the monsters you killed except for the bosses are there challenging you again and you have to kill them again. But, not everything resets itself completely. Usually 'the good stuff' only presents to you once or twice, IF you are lucky but the bad guys are always there to challenge you again and, if the world turns dark on you, to maybe slice you and dice you a few times before you develop some new and better tactics to defeat them for the 100th time again.

VIOLENCE

I believe I mentioned this all throughout my review but maybe the level of violence merits its own heading. There is A LOT of it in this game and all of it is graphic. I believe there is a setting that would hide 'bleeding' but with or without that, there was a reason it was rated 'M' as in 'mature'. So, anyone who doesn't feel comfortable about killing tens of thousands of soulless, computer generated creatures, don't buy this game.

TECHNICAL MERIT

Demon's Souls was made for the PS3 exclusively and it shows. The graphics and animations are simply breathtaking and, unlike the multi-platform Oblivion where 'fire' and 'smoke' could only be done at the expense of slowing everything to a crawl and the objects in the the distance became usually blurred, the world of Demon's Souls is almost always crisp and responsive visually, it rarely skips a frame and it never slows down, even when dozens of characters are present and moving independently on the screen.

Add to the above some of the most realistic sound effects and 'break and shatter' graphics, with the audio-visual experience enhanced by the controller perfectly synchronize vibrations that allow you to 'feel' the blows as your shield blocks them.

Unlike many other RPG worlds where a lot of the landscape and the dungeons are cookie-cutter reassemblies of a limited number of elements, the world of Boletaria appears to be fully, uniquely custom-designed. Very little repeats and every new location you discover is different and usually surprisingly different from anything else in the game.

FIVE STARS

On a 1-100 scale, I would rate Demon's Souls as a 95+. The game is remarkably bug free and the instances where characters do silly things because they can't climb a boulder or can't make a turn are rare enough for the game to stay immersive. I already know that I'll be spending more hours on Demon's Souls than on any other PS3 RPG or any other type of games I own so far.

At this price and considering the added CD, this is as most compelling buy.

Grand Theft Auto 3 has a legacy and series of cult followers behind it, this is a new title that is in it's rookie start.  SO obviously this would hold some flaws.
Now that we cleared that up lets hit the official review.  This game is not only awsome but immensly insane.  Never have I seen so many weapons and so many characters on the screen at the same time.  the graphics are a little cartoony but still portray the insanity that rioters hold.  You have the Corporation death squad on your trail but that doesn't matter because they are easy to take out, however they do get smarter, and you must avoid ambushes.
I will say that this game is difficult, and sometimes frustrating.  For example in chaos mode you have a time limit do what is needed.  More than likely you will not accomplish your goal within the time period.
Revolution mode also holds it flaws.  The story is minimal, and also the plans that the group ""Freedom"" set up are not very well planned out (in the mall I can recall 3-6 ambushes).
Overall though I gave this five stars because it's not only fun, but very unique, and I can see the hardwork put into this.  Here is a hint to do better.

My siblings and I dug this game out over the holidays, and (having memorized all the solutions to all the puzzles) went through it in one straight session. This game holds up surprisingly well for being close to a decade old. The graphics look like they were pulled straight from a cartoon, and only the pixelation in the cutscenes will hint at the game's true age. The voice acting is spot-on perfect (Alan Young, voice of Scrooge McDuck, has a hilarious role), with lots of clever dialogue and delivery and occasional references to Star Wars and other Lucasarts games. Puzzles are reasonably challenging without being too obscure, and most gamers should be able to find their way to the end without consulting a walkthrough too much, if at all.

The major strike against this game is that if you're not familiar with the Monkey Island series, a portion of the story and background will leave you scratching your head (such as why Guybrush starts the game floating in a bumper car in the middle of the ocean). The first two installments in the game were DOS-based, and they were old even when Curse of Monkey Island was new. There's actually a huge portion of the game at the end dedicated to sorting out all the various plot threads of the series, and new players might find this a little drawn out. Still, the basic premise of the game is simple enough to follow.

There's no guarantee this game will work on WindowsXP, but I've had no problems running it, so it's worth giving it a shot (a group of fans also developed programs to make the game run smoother, for those having difficulty with it).

5.0,False,"04 2, 2014",ANS7PVYBOXVGO,B000034DMG,JackLiberty,"The series of Resident Evil continues with its sequel Resident Evil 2 on PlayStation released in 1998 and developed by Capcom once again. It takes place in Raccoon City which is the closest residence of the mansion from the first game. This time, the entire city has been transformed into zombies from the outbreak of the T-virus created by Umbrella. You get to play as two characters: Leon S. Kennedy (disc one) who is a Raccoon City Police Officer on his first day of the job and Claire Redfield (disc two) who came into town to search for her missing brother Chris Redfield who was one of the main characters in the first Resident Evil game. Both characters get their own set of weapons and storylines, but it doesnt matter what order you play them in.

The gameplay features the same basic principles as the first game. You have to solve puzzles, use a limited supply of ammunition, herbs to heal wounds, carry only eight items, and use typewriters to save. Its nice they stuck with the original format of the first game and I wish every Resident Evil game in the series was like this.

You get some new weapons such as a bowgun, sub machine gun, spark gun and upgrades to Leons handgun, shotgun and magnum. The aiming feels more comfortable and you always seem to be in control of where you shoot. One downside is that auto aim isn't set by default. When you start the game, you have to press Select to get to the options, select the controller settings and set the mode to Type C to turn the auto aim feature on. A nice new addition is that the characters current health can be determined by their posture and movement speed. This makes it easier to tell what condition your player is in and you don't have to go to the inventory screen to find out how much health you have like with the first game. The Item Boxes are back where you can store items you don't need and pick up later, but a new item you can retrieve is the Side Pack which will allow you to carry two more items increasing your total to ten. Both Leon and Claire are joined by a support partner throughout the story. Leon is aided by a woman named Ada Wong who is searching for her boyfriend. Claire is aided by a 12 year old girl named Sherry who was told to go to the police station because of the dangers in Raccoon City. But even the police station is infested with zombies and bio weapons. The enemies in this game are really memorable; there are the lickers who are just terrifying and powerful, especially later in the game. Then theres Mr. X who is like the Terminator, he always comes back to hunt you down.

The most innovative feature in this game is that there are different scenarios in this game. Say you play as Leon and complete the game as him; well you can then play as Claire in that same scenario to find out the true ending. And you cant play Claires second scenario by popping in the second disc for the first time to play as her, you have to unlock it first. So in total, there are four possible scenarios in this game.

Another innovative feature is that you get a ranking based on the total amount of time it took to complete a scenario, the number of saves and healing items you use. If you do well, you can unlock some goodies such as infinite ammo for a sub machine gun, gatling gun, rocket launcher, unlock special outfits and three new mini games. The first mini game, you play as Hunk, whose mission is to escape the Raccoon City Police Department with the latest G-Virus created by Umbrella. The second mode is known as Extreme Battle in which you play through the entire map of the game and you have to locate four special bombs to destroy the T-Virus in Umbrellas Lab before it can cause a lot of damage. You get to play as four characters: Leon, Claire, Ada and Claires brother Chris. Each has their own set of weapons and you can adjust a difficulty setting to fight stronger monsters including bosses from the regular game. The third and final game mode is called Tofu and it is the strangest mini game I have ever seen. You play as this giant block of Tofu (Yes, I am dead serious, a giant piece of Tofu) and in terms of the objective its the same as Hunks mission except you play as Tofu, who is only equipped with a combat knife, so it makes this mini game very difficult to complete. Ive completed the mode as Hunk, but never as Tofu. The good news however is that Tofu takes a lot of hits to kill so basically the only way to complete this game is to run. Dont even bother fighting the enemies, the knife in Resident Evil 2 is just extremely weak and isn't worth the time. Still this mode is worth playing just for the amusement factor because Tofu says some funny Japanese phrases whenever he gets hurt. Its funny, even though I cant understand it. It is also pretty difficult to unlock, you have to get an A ranking at least six times to play this mini game. For the Extreme Battle and Hunk, you only need two A rankings.

One thing I didn't mention yet is that the music is really awesome. It has orchestral themes and even opera themes and it fits the game very well. There were many different versions of this game. There was an updated version on PlayStation called Resident Evil 2: Dual Shock Edition which is the same as the regular game except it supports the PlayStations DualShock controllers analog stick and vibration function. The Extreme Battle Mode I mentioned is exclusive only to the Dual Shock Edition. Theres also a Rookie mode which gives the player a Machine Gun with infinite ammo at the start of the game, but you cant unlock the other mini games playing this difficulty even if you get an A ranking, you have to play Normal mode to unlock them. Another cool thing about the Dual Shock Version is you can use a cheat code to give yourself unlimited ammo. You just go to the control settings, hold R1 and press square repeatedly until the icon turns red. This version was later released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation 3.

There were also ports on the PC and Dreamcast with slightly better graphics, higher frame rate and an art gallery. There was even a port on the Game com. It was a s***ty 2D black and white handheld console by Tiger. That port is just pathetic; Im not even going to discuss it. The best port however is the Nintendo 64 version. The sound on the Nintendo 64 version is better than the PlayStations version, it has updated graphics, new costumes, a setting to adjust the violence and blood color, a more responsive aiming control scheme, new files, cheat codes to give you infinite health and ammo and the most interesting feature of all is a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough so it definitely has more variety. The only thing its missing is the Extreme Battle mini game. But this port is equally as good as the PlayStations version.

Any criticisms I have with this game? Well its hard for me to think of things I don't like about this game, I guess a minor criticism is that you cant skip the in game cut scenes, you couldn't do that in the first game and its a minor annoyance when you already played the game a million times like I did and just want to get through the game. The problem most people have with this game is the beginning. You start the game surrounded by about ten zombies with a slow handgun. The first time playing, you only have a few seconds to figure out the controls until the zombies corner and kill you. It definitely sounds like a terrible idea to start next to the zombies. My strategy is to just run away. Hold square, press up on the d-pad to run and use up-left and up-right to get around the enemies. Once you figure that out, it isn't too hard to get past the zombies and give yourself some breathing room. It did take me a while to figure out the controls but Ive mastered it and you can too. The voice acting in this game is much better than the first Resident Evil, but still nothing too special. Thats about all the criticisms I can think of.

When I was a kid, I used to play the s*** out of this game and in my opinion; this is undeniably not only the best Resident Evil game, but the best survival horror game and one of the best PlayStation games I have ever played. This game still manages to be very scary, if you're playing this for the first time, you are guaranteed to be so scared; your heart will burst out your chest. Trust me; I had my jumps even to this day. Its more fun playing this game alone in your room in the dark, with the volume turned up. This makes for a terrifying and memorable experience. I absolutely love this game, its just a masterpiece. Id recommend getting the version from the PlayStation Store to play on the PS3 for only $6, or the regular PlayStation version or the Nintendo 64 version. Those are the best options. The replay value is very high for me and I could play this game at any time. You will admire this game and its by far the best in the entire series.

The bad thing is, you have to actually play the levels and do the challenges to unlock all the cool options. But its worth it! One bad thing is the aiming system though, its very jerky, especially the sniper rifle. The sniper is utterly useless in the fast paced multiplayer environment. The custom map creator is a plus too!

Modifieds: The best thing about this game,wish they'd include some dirt tracks for modifieds
Trucks: Trucks are fun,just wish they'd include a few more truck only tracks(Myrtle Beach)instead of driving on so many fantasy tracks

Cup Series: This is it. The Cup Series. The most horsepower of anything in the game. The most adrenaline. The most everything.

The only problem with this game, once you pick the settings in the Fight for the Top mode, you're stuck with them (unless you want to start new game). That's a problem because, as you progress, you'll need less and less ""driver assist"" and will want to compete agains better AI competitors (rookies, veterans, legends) and change other settings related to tire wear, refueling, damage, etc. That being said with EA's Nascar contract up,this looks like the last really good EA Nascar game.

5.0,False,"03 12, 2016",AOYGPHW4YMYEO,B00DEL3IIS,Shaide,"Unless you have been living under a rock for the last few years, you have no doubt at the very least heard whispering about an upcoming game called Tom Clancys: The Division. Just in case you actually have been living under a rock (In which case, I am really sorry..that was a poor taste joke!) let me give you the brief run down! The Division is is a Massively Multiplayer 3rd person cover based shooter with RPG elements. The game is released from Ubisoft, under their Tom Clancy brand, and is one of the most highly anticipated game releases of 2016. Its being released on multiple formats including PC, Xbox One and PS4.

Personally I picked it up on PS4, because I prefer playing certain games on a console(3rd person shooters being one of them). Some things to be aware of though, the PC version of the game requires a beast of a computer. If you aren't sure if your system could handle it, you could always check on Can YOU run it and see what it says, though to be fair CYRI isn't always very accurate. According to it, my computer cant play Rise of the Tomb Raider, but not only can I play it, but I run it on the highest graphic setting.

You play a character who is basically a sleeper agent who is activated when a major attack happens on New York. You run through a very detailed recreation of New York City, and help people when you can. This help comes in the forms of missions where you rescue hostages, reclaim food and aid drops that have been stolen by gangs, protecting the people from riots, or even just giving them food/water/first aid kits when a person approaches you on the street randomly and asks for aid.

Along the way you can craft, buy and find better equipment or cosmetic items to help you customize your look so that you stand out from the rest of the playerbase. These items really are important too if you don't want to look like every other agent in the field, because unfortunately there aren't very many options while creating your character(At least for males, i haven't tried female character creation, because Im a male)..So, theres a good chance you are going to bump into people who look a lot like youthats when the cosmetic items come in handy!

You begin the game in Brooklyn, which serves as a tutorial area of sorts. Once you secure/stabilize that area you are sent off to a more dangerous location..Manhattan! Thats where the game actually begins. Its also the area that people involved in the open and closed beta tests experienced, so its at this point when the game might get boring for some, since they have already experienced a good portion of this early content.

The game seems to be, at least at these early levels, very solo friendly. In fact, your game world is mostly instanced, and you are alone on the city streets unless you group up with someone. There are public hub zones where you can meet up with other agents, and especially right now, finding groups is extremely easy. While the game can be done solo, there are certain main missions that are very difficult, and are much easier with a group.

Aside from the Main Mission the game seems to be packed with content, tons of side missions and encounters. basically enough to keep you constantly busy. The side missions are also very important! If you skip them, and just focus on the story missions you are going to have some problems. You do need to level up, you also need to bulk up your wallet so you can buy new gear, or at the very least find new gear so you live longer in the next portion of the story mission.

The game also does have some PvP, but I haven't really focused much on it, I just dabbled here and there. PvP seems to take place in an area called the Dark Zone(Which incidentally is also where most of the best loot can be found. So, if you want the best equipment, you are going to have to brave that area eventually. Though I would recommend going with friends, people you can trust, cause the agents there looking to swipe your newly acquired loot? Odds are, they are working in groups too.

The voice acting is fairly good, though your character is your standard MMO Strong Silent Type, but the people you interact with do a fairly decent job of acting out their roles. This includes not just the main Characters, but also the quest givers and even the people on the side of the road just talking. Everyone does a great job, and I find that really impressive.

The gameplay is pretty much your typical 3rd person shooter. You take cover behind a wall or a car, pop out and fire off a few bursts of bullets at your enemies, duck back into cover and reload. Maybe toss out a grenade to spice things up on your enemies, especially when they are either clumped all together or dug in really good and you cant seem to hit anyone with your spray of bullets. Basically if you have played a 3rd person shooter, you will get the hang of the play mechanics quite quickly. This is good, since it doesnt have a huge learning curve. You won't find yourself keeling over dead at every turn of the corner due to an allergic reaction to bullets.

The story is overall pretty decent! I don't want to delve to much into it, so as to spoil it. However what I can say, is that it seems to be a pretty solid storyline. At least so far. Things might get weird and crazy and boring as the game progresses, but for the moment its got a good solid plot.

In fact, my only complaint is the name. Not so much the name I guess, but the brand. Its branded under the Tom Clancy label, which I don't really get. The game isn't based on any existing Clancy book or story, and it isn't even set in the Tom Clancy Universe. So, basically it isn't canon to anything released with the name Tom Clancy on it. So, why bother with the brand? If its not set in the Clancyverse, and in fact has no connection to anything written by Tom Clancy, why does it have his brand? Im sure there is a reason, I just don't know it.

When all is said and done I believe the game is pretty great! I would totally recommend this game to anyone who loves MMOs or third person shooters in general.",the best MMO i've played in years!,1457740800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

But there was some glitches like the helicopter glitch, anyways it was still under constructions.

I think if you like Farcry 3/4 you might like this one aswell, Because I find it similar to it, but bit boarded because in Ghost recon wildlands, you can do Character customization for both Male/Female But I personally find it very limited. Specially when creating a player look for example, in each gender, you get around 11 faces to choose from. As for clothes choices its not much either but thanks to the ton of Materials to choose from you can hardly find someone wearing something like you.

Overall, every Game has its Pros and cons:

Pros:
Great graphics and lightning / Cars light could be dim at night though.
Big map, fun to explore especially if you're hanging out with friends / yet as soon as your familiar and far in the game with it you might feel some emptiness.
Nice weapon customization, lots of free weapons paints matches your taste.
Lots of clothing Materials to choose from.
Playing Solo is quite fun, Thanks to the AI mod and rebels support.
There is some very helpful 90 hints you can check out in both loading screen and pause menu

Cons:
- I didn't like the Store idea, because you're required to buy things with real money.
- Playing coop is almost impossible sometimes due to error ""Tarija 00013/14""
-Cars in Bolivia are very limited.
-No first person view or honk in cars.
-Face/Hair/Tattoo options are limited.
-You can't choose voice for character.
-You can only Mute a Coop player mic / no option let you control the volume, some people speak so loud which I find annoying, I could hear them breathing in my ear.

In the next updates I hope they allow us to control volume of coop mics. I also hope they add more FREE casual style clothes I know it's supposed to be military type thing but it's always good to have more options and styles. And also FREE Cars, FREE hairstyles, FREE Tattoos.

Since then I was an addict of these types of games (Hexen, Heretic, Quake, Duke Nukem, Blood, Jedi Knight...you name it) until I kind of ""grew out"" of it. I guess I just got sick of them in a way because there are just so many out there. So I never set my eye on these kinds of games again. But being a hardcore Star Trek fan, Elite Force really caught my attention. I just thought, ""What the heck?"", pulled two twenties out of my pocket, and took it home. I was really shocked! This game was fun! I just could not stop playing. Not only did it have good graphics, speed, etc., but it actually felt like I was part of an episode of Star Trek Voyager. That's what made it so fun to play for me, along with the heart-pumping action (unlike most 3D shooters, the monsters aren't those slow, zombie-type, moaning/growling type...monsters in this game actually scream, bum rush you and tear you up!).
I am almost absolutely certain that any Star Trek fan would love this game. Even if you finish the game once, you'd still wanna play it again.

Enrico Chivaldori, trying to keep his family in power, took a wife, Deidranna Reitman, in order to boost his popularity as a candidate.  Then everything began to tumble...
Deidranna killed Chivaldori's father and framed him through a large amount of circumstantial evidence.  She turned him over to his political enemy, Miguel Cordona, in the hopes that Cordona would kill him, instead, they helped him flee.  Deidranna has since turned the peaceful country of Arulco into a destitute land ruled by the whim of a rutheless dictator, acts of genocide are common, and anyone not of value of swiftly removed from the population...Now it is time to remove her.
A shadowy figure...you...meets with exiled Enrico Chivaldori in the Czech Republic, he explains what he wants you to do: build an army out of mercenaries, and topple Deidranna's regime.
This shows how rich and deep the story is, but it would be irrelevant if the gameplay wasn't good.  Thankfully, the game play is brilliant.  Using an ingenious laptop interface, you take the money given to you by Chivaldori and hire the best mercenaries you can.  You figh from town to town and in the rural areas, killing Deidranna's forces with firepower and tactics.  This is no mere ""shoot-em-up,"" the player must train militas, guard mines, take down SAM sites to clear the skies, make sure your mercs interact well, train your mercs,talk to characters, some of whom can be recruited to your cause, some of whom will attempt to kill you.
But you also get to take on Deidranna's forces with over 25 weapons and other items.  There will be weapons you haven't seen and creatures native to Arulco (more so if you choose the Sci-Fi) option.  Combat is great fun, and there is a lot of it.  Moreover, the game is completely non-linear, so if you wish to make a run on the Capital City of Meduna and Deidranna herself only 2 hours into the game, by all means do so, just don't worry if you're sent back in a body bag.

I still had about 100 of the download puzzles to finish when Picross 3D came out. Wow. Having played 350 of its puzzles so far, it's time for me to rate this sucker.

Out of 10, I give it a 9.

The 3D aspect is fun. If you love Picross, this is definitely the next step. You solve the puzzles in 2D slices from 2 different dimensions, so it's really just stacking of the previous type puzzles.

Why do I like it so much? Because I get a larger sense of accomplishment than I did from the 2D Picross games. Carving out the puzzle object from the block is more fun than just marking a flat grid. I definitely enjoy using the stylus to explode/break/chip away block pieces. (No stylus available for the original Picross, and I found it a nuisance in the DS version)

Limitations - Size. I loved hitting up a 25x25 grid in Picross DS, but max size here is only 10x10x10. It's probably a decision made by the designers for ease of use, as it might be too hard to select tinier cubes ... but it might be fun to spend a few hours slowly chipping away a more massive block.

Dislike - Timers. Losing points to a time-limit can result in missing bonus puzzles. I want to play 100% of the games, so am busting my hump on some of the hard level boards.

Another dislike - I think some of these puzzles aren't solved by logic. Maybe I'm missing a circle or square combo? I dunno ... but I've had to guess on a bunch of the puzzles.

5.0,False,"12 6, 2007",ATHPTNOCCDC8T,B000XGJH1O,C. Taylor,"First impression is, ""Wow!"" The PS3 turns out to be a great system. I purchased the 40gb model Dec. 2007. I was not interested at the initial release due to the over-hype and price. However, with the latest updates the PS3 is finally readily available and costs LESS than a comparably configured 360. For reference, I also own a new 360 and a Wii.

Compared to the 360 the PS3 is a better value, it performs better, and it is much quieter.

Value. Consider the current state of the market:

Xbox: 400 + HD-DVD 170 + HDMI: 30 + Wifi: 100 + Online: 50/yr = 750
PS3: 500 + HDMI: 30 + Wifi: 0 + Online: 0 + A2 (Toshiba HD-DVD movie player):150 = 680

The less expensive solution gives you BOTH blu-ray and HD dvd movie formats.

Performance. This is largely a factor of the game studio. All I know is that the games I have played on the PS3 have all been smoother than the 360. Also, the textures load faster. The graphics in Uncharted, for example, are sick (way better than the current 360 exclusive Mass Effect). Playing Uncharted on my 1080p tv gives me the ""wow"" factor.

Noise. The PS3 is much quieter, so much that you will not hear it when playing or more importantly while watching dvd's. The 360 on the other hand, is like watching movies while your mom is vacuuming. To me, this was the deal breaker and the main reason why I even considered trying a PS3 in the first place.

Some common complaints about the PS3 and my counterpoints. Complaint: Not many titles. Counter: Not true as of Dec 2007. The quality of titles on the PS3 is what you need to consider. There are many great games out there for any genre that you like. Honestly, how many games do you need? Each game is 50+ unless you buy used. Do you really need and can you afford 100 games? For every genre of gaming, I can name a few outstanding titles. For example, Action (Uncharted), RPG (Oblivion), Online (Warhawk), War (MGS). It is beyond the scope of this review to name all of the great PS3 games that currently exist. My advice is to decide what kind of game you're in the mood for and do a little bit of online research. Complaint: Costs more. Counterpoint: Not true as outlined above. Complaint: Tied to Blu-Ray. Counterpoint: True but blu ray has many exclusive movies that you cannot currently get in HD. And, in the final analysis you can still buy a HD DVD player and have BOTH formats and pay LESS than what you would for a comparably configured 360 with a HD player alone.

The list of pros and cons can go on and on but I'd like to sum up by saying that I am genuinely impressed with the PS3. I wish I would have considered it sooner, before I bought my noisy, clunky 360. Nobody knows the future but my guess is that the PS3 console will continue to come down in price and PS3/blu-ray titles will continue to expand. Given the current state of the industry (Dec. 2007) I can heartily endorse the PS3 and I would strongly urge anyone who is trying to decide between a PS3 and 360 to just buy the PS3 and don't look back.

Coming from many years of FPS on a PC, I was really surprised how little time it took me to get used to the controls. They are fluid and precise.

Another thing I loved is the style of graphics, not just the detail, but the feel of the environment. I think this is what sets it apart from all other FPS games.

Another thing I really like about this is that there's no single weapon that you can use to get through the whole game. You need to constantly change weapons based on the situation your in. Shotgun is a must in close combat, while your basic M Carbine is still most effective in outdoor battles. Also, (and this might just be a coincidence) it seems like the game PUSHES you to use different weapons. If I use the same rifle for too long, the ammunition for it becomes more difficult to find, but you come across plenty of ammo for your other weapons. Switch to one of them and suddenly you find ammo for the one you just ran out of. Maybe that's just me, but maybe it's a pretty clever design feature.

I'm not hanging on the cutting edge of technology...I usually wait for awhile until stuff goes on sale for my nearly-defunct consoles, and it might take even longer for me to actually get around to really playing the game. I have been meaning to pick up Solatorobo: Red The Hunter for several years now and I ordered it once but there was a shipping error, I got refunded, then I forgot about trying to get it and it sat on my wishlist for some time. A month ago I was ""cleaning up"" my wishlist so I tossed it back into the cart. The only reason I bought it was because I liked the artwork on the cover and I read a few reviews saying it was one of those really good games that not enough people become aware of.

The other day the power went out and I plopped down on the bed with my Nintendo DS and Solatorobo. I was very fond of the PS One game ""Tail Concerto"" back in the day, and I had no idea this game was related to it. As soon as I began playing, though, it brought back the familiar thrill of Tail Concerto and I was instantly immersed in the gameplay. Solatorobo has excellent controls and amazing graphics. Whenever a console is near the end of its run, a few games will always come out that really push the limits of what it can do. Those games are *always* amazing and never get the attention they deserve because people are usually focusing on the next console coming out and what it can do. All the while not realizing that the old console they have turned away from still had great potential that only seems to be unlocked after years of game development.

This game looks and plays better than many sloppy, clunky games on the 3DS. The story is involving, the characters have depth and are cute and fun. I think that may be what turns some gameplayers away, they see ""cute"" and instantly think it's for girls or very young children, but that is not the case. The canine & feline anthropomorphic characters look like they're straight out of an anime series. Add into the mix cool mechas to ride around in, a somewhat steampunk-inspired world of floating islands over a plasma sea, and you are beginning to get an idea what the game is like. The graphics are, interestingly, a combination of 2D and 3D sprites mixed together with animated cut scenes. It reminded me also a little of Klonoa. The backgrounds are lush and impressive.

The gameplay involves a lot of hopping around in the mech and picking things up and throwing them. There elements of not only fighting and platformer games but RPG as well. The only thing that has been somewhat annoying is that the game, while very fun and sometimes challenging, is not terribly difficult. I kept feeling like I was in introduction mode even when I wasn't. You will get the hang of things very quickly and it's annoying that the game keeps stopping gameplay to give you tips, help you don't need and generally hold your hand when you don't want it. It doesn't entirely ruin things and it's still a great game but I wish the difficulty level was higher. But there are lots of quests to unlock and different mechs open up different map areas.

There isn't any cohesive story or narrative that links the 10 different scenarios, but then again, that's not a guarantee in real life, either. The actual game play rewards careful planning and strategy. It isn't a game for people who want to run into a room, shoot everyone, and continue. The game's scoring at the end of each level encourages you to arrest the suspects, not kill them. This is accomplished by using the non-lethal weapons. Of course, this is only a factor in the single player and COOP. In multi player, you can feel free to take whatever gun you want and mow down the opposition. The COOP is by far the best aspect of this game. You can team up with 10 people to take on the single player or any fan made missions. The levels all feel unique and are designed appropriately. Office buildings have big conference rooms. Garages have cars. Banks have those unnecessary rooms where they tell you that your loan was declined. Everything feels right. Enemies have random placements in each level, so you can't just memorize where everyone is and proceed. You have to proceed with caution no matter how many times you've done a level.

I personally use the the mouse left handed when doing casual tasks (surfing web, watching videos, typing essays, etc) and right handed when gaming to put myself in a focused mindset when gaming competitively. Or via versa if you like, I already have a lot of years gaming right handed so it's hard to convert.

Note that this mouse is not ambidextrous, but has similar features minus 2 programmable buttons and has a pinky rest.

-This mouse is thin in terms of thickness so your hand is closer to the ground than most mouses, again, may help with precision and accuracy.

-There's textured rubber side grips which feels very comfortable to rest before having to press the side buttons. Great for fingertip or claw grip users

-Mouse feet glides well with no issues

-Lightweight.
Feels very natural in the hand. For those who like weighted mouses, unfortunately there's no added weight options

--Optical sensor.

Has an optical instead of a laser sensor

No jittering at high dpi or having to lift the mouse to reconfigure yourself.  No spin outs (character rotates 280 degrees + in FPS) when gliding the mouse forcefully.

Less time blaming the mouse than your game/skills

--Buttons
Left and right click feels a bit loose/floaty before you click them in compared to other mice. You are not using extra finger pressure, but an odd sensation if you're not used to it.

Scroll wheel is a bit stiff. Good for internet browsing, but also for those use use the scroll wheel for weapon change where you don't want to accidentally skip over a weapon select.

There are  two programmable button on each side, which you can configure to your liking. I personally use 3 of the 4 when gaming, but a housemate that tried it said he kept accidentally pressing the right side buttons (when using right handed) with his pinky and ring finger during tense situations. You can disable one side if you like via the downloaded software.

Side buttons has less travel for the default configuration (where your thumb is closest to). For the buttons on the opposite end, some muscle memory is required if you plan to use those buttons, and have this mouse be your main gaming mouse

DPI button is out of the way in the center. Most likely you're not going to press the button accidentally

--Software
With downloaded software you can:
Pre-select macro and keyboard buttons to mouse
Change LED color and frequency change
Change Sensitivity

If you own a steelseries mouse previously, you may have to uninstall/re-install program if the program does not recognize the mouse. If so, make sure you screen shot your configuration before uninstalling, unless you have a good memory of your setup.

Overall, very good gaming mouse that has great precision and accuracy. Prefect fit for left handers.

Due the use of a lot of macros and programmable buttons on both, as it's more comfortable/reliable using these than a flat keyboard (having only use keyboard for chat functionality), especially with the flick down switch on the rival 500 for space bar button/jumps

This is personal preference though as each setup is different for everybody. For any mouse, including this one, i recommend getting the Razor Tartarus especially when you are on a gaming binge and don't want your fingers getting fatigued or strained

Pro Gaming Tip:  As mentioned before, if you plan to get the most out of your gaming experience, best to use different mouse and/or hands for casual and gaming use as it keeps you from acting lazy, and helps you be more focused during game sessions.

5.0,True,"12 30, 2011",A3C0WSRUOCD8IG,B006GVLNV2,That Review Guy,"since I reviewed the regular game, I will just review what's new here:

the game now comes packaged with Multiplayer map pack 1 (7 DM Maps, 4 adventure maps and 3 CC maps)and the Pirates singleplayer expansion. you also get an in game item (pin)also a real pin to wear.
a huge two sided map of the world, the velvet case with special edition dvd
(making of etc dvd) all the DLC is On the Disc for a nice change (thought for sure they would be codes) but this great package is brought down by a major flaw
and that is if you owned the previous version of the game and played online or offline you CANNOT IMPORT YOUR SAVE! that's right you cannot bring in your Multiplayer characters (so no level 300+ character for you) nor can you import your singleplayer save. I have written to topware and they simply told me they had to make a new save slot, that they had to and to contact ""the unknown"" via the zuxxez forums. sad they ruined a perfect package. my review score is ONLY based upon the package. not the problem. since this is a Fine package if you didn't already buy the game. also the expansion now has weather effects.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Hack (workaround) for importing save games:

This is caused by the fact that PS3 TWII GotY is formally different game then TWII - it have different ""titleID"" and so different saves folder.

There is a hack in game which lets you ""import"" saves from TWII:
you do this at the main menu.

- open commands console:

Hold down L1 + R1 then while holding it down press sequentially: SELECT then DPAD LEFT then SELECT then DPAD RIGHT. An input box+on-screen keyboard should appear.
then put in the game.loaddir BLUS30550 and hit start. (this is the US Code) then you're done (except for saving) use codes below for different regions.

- in console type: game.loaddir BLES00845 (UK) (for US version type: game.loaddir BLUS30550, for JAP: game.loaddir BLJM60268) and press START to accept command.

this imports ALL your saves at once including MP and SP. once done just go into multiplayer and force it to save each character and then go into singleplayer and save there too. then you're all done! I tested this and it works perfectly.

  Original Review:

I ordered Two Worlds II almost a year ago. I just had a good feeling about it and I was right! it's so beautifully rendered the graphics are among the best I have seen in a ps3 RPG. (except Skyrim!)
the gameplay is fun, primarily Hack & Slash (though enemies can be really stupid which I don't mind at all) you can swim, sail, ride a horse and of course be ANY class you wish! the customization is so deep as is the crafting. I have spent hours just tweaking spells and weapons I think I could just do this for 100+ hours. I've been playing non stop since it's release and am completely addicted!!!!
many people are comparing this to oblivion, the world is bigger I'd wager, I think it's better and harder which I prefer.
the online modes are amazing and fun. I've read of glitches but I
have experienced none. the voice acting is by and far NOT the worst I ever heard. it's actually not bad at all (when compared to the severely wooden acting of SOME other games I will NOT name..) if you liked oblivion and
thought to yourself ""I want More"" this could be the perfect fix until Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.
the graphics are really amazing with some of the best lighting effects I have seen in any RPG on PS3.
the controls take getting used to but you can assign hotkeys and this speeds things up very well. also I loved the fact that no armor/weapon you loved (early on in the game) is useless,
you may disassemble any weapons and armor for the base components
to make your new weapons/armor far more powerful (though the sell price doesn't change) I'd easily recommend this RPG to ALL Major RPG fans!
the game is simply a blast online or offline.
your single player character cannot be used in multiplayer *sniffle*
though I can cope with having several characters. I especally LOVE they put Necromancy in this to summon your own virtual army much like diablo II's Necromancer and that's just awesome!
the game is deeper then the ocean! I've never seen the ability to craft on this level since Ultima Online and this is even Deeper!!!
the enemies are excellent and well varied, the backdrops are beautiful, amazing graphics and wonderful sound. what more could one want? buy it now (or rent if you're not sure) it's easily worth it.
and I am only about 45 hours into it so far!!!!!
if I had to hazard a guess I bet (like oblivion) you could easily milk 400+ hours out of this between Online 8 Player and Offline!
ONLINE GAME MODES:
Deathmatch (4 on 4 kill or be killed.
Duel (1 on 1 deathmatch. a very fun mode)
Adventure (a co-op 8 player adventure)
Village mode (cost 10,000 auras to begin playing)
Crystal Capture (similar to a CTF in a FPS but collecting crystals)
a little advice about playing Online, if you're just starting out try adventure mode to do some leveling for if you enter deathmatch via using Quick Join you will Die Fast so do some adventuring first and save needless deaths! it really is a blast to play online so don't overlook it!

Graphics: Amazing! 5 stars
Voice acting: on par 3.5 stars
Gameplay: simple to learn difficult to master 4 stars
Sound: the ambient sounds are incredible (turn the music off and see)
5 stars!!
FUN you can assasinate, steal, pickpocket, summon armies, fight hand to hand, use dual wield, one and two handed weapons, archery, cast amazing spells and so much more!! (and you can craft them and decide all effects of the spell) I can't praise this game enough it's beautiful and even the rising/setting sun is an excellent touch.

my hats off to southpeak for creating a true gem!

Overall: this is a MUST OWN RPG for the casual and Hardcore alike
easily the best RPG so far this year 5 stars!

UPDATE: 1/10/12
the online community has diminished a bit but it's still easy to find
online matches (or just host one) the new adventure maps are really fun and different from the other maps. you can now even kill a Crystal Golem to get the Crystal Sword/Shield?/Axe that were not in MP Before this expansion.
the new DM and CC maps are just as good with more of them then the adventure maps
(4 new adventure maps, 7 Deathmatch maps, and 3 crystal capture maps)
the single player has been nicely expanded as well. the pirates expansion has weather effects which are a really nice touch (standing in a graveyard with lightning flashing is more sinister then a peaceful daylight graveyard!
the sailing mechanic has been expanded with a ""simple"" mode for those that want to explore instead of fiddling with wind and the sail. in this ""simple"" mode you simply point the ship where you'd like to go and the A.I. takes care of the sail ETC. to speed up sailing so now it's more fun for those not seeking ""realism"".
one of the boss fights is a tad unfair for those of us that were never good at using the flute or drums etc. this boss requires you to play a melody in about 24 seconds lol. I will get past it,just not anytime soon. otherwise this ""Velvet Edition"" was worth every penny I spent on it especally since both DLC packs are On The Disc! also, there's new weapons & armor including Horse Armor (though not really needed) and a nifty new bow was also added the Crossbow! it's deadly compared to other bows but is a whole lot slower to reload. overall it's a stellar package no one should overlook.",Two worlds 2 goes Velvet!,1325203200,14,,

You can customize pretty much any part on the car, from the lisense plates and window tint colors, to the trim and NOS color.  And with almost every upgrade, you can choose a custom color for it (window tints, neon colors, exhast color, etc).

Now I own Need For Speed Rivals and Midnight Club 3.  And I have also rented Ridge Racers for a month at gamefly.com.

Now with Ridge Racers, nothing could be customized, except for the car color.  And the races were really boring, you always started in last.  The turning was kind of weird because you didn't turn, you slid.  And there was no real music, just like intense elevator music.  With the other two, you get actual songs to listen to while you race.  This game isn't worth the $40, but might be worth the $20 to some people, to get a used copy, at gamefly.com.

Need For Speed Rivals is a pretty good game.  Most things are customizable, but you had to choose from their colors, and almost everything was locked.  With Midnight Club 3, almost everything was unlocked, you just can't afford everything yet.  Need For Speed Rivals did have more race types, but you couldn't free-roam like on the PS2 version (Neeed For Speed Underground 2) or like on Mignight Club.  Need For Speed Rivals was a great game at the PSP Launch, but now I give it about 3.5/5, after seeing Mignight Club 3.  I guess Need For Speed Rivals is worth the $40, but go for midnight club if you can.

Now Midnight Club 3 for the PSP is awesome!  I rented the PS2 version on gamefly.com for about a month, and both are almost identical. I have noticed only two major differences:

1.  Slower loader times!  It could take about 45 seconds to load the garage, or about a minute to load the free-roam mode, or a race.  But it's still worth it, because you can go anywhere in the city, and check out any part in the garage.

2.  Controls are pretty different from the PS2 version.  Some features are on different buttons, but you get used to them in about 5-15 minutes.

Out of these three PSP racing games I say that Midnight Club 3 is a winner.  It's definately worth the $50 (or $40 on eBay).  If you don't believe me, maybe you should rent it at gamefly.com.",Awesome Game!!,1121472000,25,{'Platform:': ' Sony PSP'},

The more story-driven FF games tend to focus primarily on a single lead character, but Final Fantasy VI doesn't have just one lead It has 12 of them. Plus, every character is a very distinct entity with their own unique skills, personality, and quirks.
You can also customize them as you please with special accessories and techniques and boosts granted through the use of Magicite. The epic presentation matches the story - many games threaten you with the end of the world, but so few games have the cajones to actually carry out global destruction over the course of the narrative.

Final Fantasy VI also to me hit a sweet spot in it's difficulty,it's challenging enough to keep you interested but never becomes so hard That it's makes you want to explode with anger. To me that's ideal as I usually play video game to escape stress,not add to it.
Final Fantasy VI also seemed More fun to to me then any other Final Fantasy.
The music is fantastic as well.
Now here's the part were i explain why FFVI ascends the turn based Rpg(my favorite genre),and become the best game i ever played.

A lot of games i've played after a few years start to bore me,but even though i've been playing this game since 2006 i have yet to get bored.
Any game that still can feel fun after 6 years and over 20 playthroughs is to me is worthy of being called one of the best games ever.
However,Final Fantasy VI is top of the top,the best of the best,because It did something no other game has done for me it mad me so immersed in the gameplay and the story that when sad moments happened i cried,and joyful moments i was happy,and when I finally met the main villian,i hated him. No game has ever done that for me before,or since.

Why is that? I think because alot of games focus more on one aspect,then trying to balance everything out.
Like Some games focus on the story,others focus on the gameplay and a few games were too easy or too hard for me to truly enjoy them.
Some day I'm sure there will be a game i find a game i like more then this,and honestly I can't wait.","Why Final Fantasy VI,is my personal favorite game of all time.",1368748800,,,

You can level up over and over again on the same level, but trust me, it grows tedious once you do this so many times, because the longer you grind, the wider the exp gap widens, so you will have to progress to stronger dudes at some point, so you can keep leveling up. You can gain titles and unlook items that will take away 99.9% of all the games' frustrations, which aren't game difficulty, but rather item upgrading/monster purifying. Gaining some allies will literally make you unstoppable and of course some items are literally ""UBER"" when you get them. Another interesting tidbit about the game is the Haniwas. These are cute looking creatures, that make cute sounds, but have various attack levels with some so powerful, you're gonna get prison raped whether you drop the soap or not. SPOILER ALERT---To sum this game up, Get Prier to Level 600 or higher, Beat Zombie King for Godhand, Purify a team of Zombie Kings, Level up in Dark World until gain first title, Level up in the Dark World gaining powerful items and allies LIKE NEVER BEFORE POSSIBLE, beat the Great Baal for RobotSuit, Purify a team of Great Baals and wreak devastation in Dark World to get the second title. Seriously though, don't get the second title. Just skip past 10th floor. Just keep wreaking devastation in Dark World...FOREVER!!!! No, not forever, gotta eat, but after eating...more devastation!!!

It has been very difficult to find any games like X-com, Jagged Alliance, Captain Tsubasa, Heroes of Might and Magic, these days. There was also a PC game back in the day which will always have a place in my heart and it's called INCUBATION. This game plays EXACTLY like Incubation so if you played that game before you MUST have this game.

I just bought this game and started playing this weekend. Beautiful representation of the story in which every single cutscene or gameplay is listed as a single part in a story book, which also looks like a comic-book. You can go back to any cutscene or mission this way, it is very well thought. The story itself might be dull for others but I'm really enjoying it and already feel like a member of the SQUAD 7. However, I wish the story was a little adult themed, like Full Metal Alchemist because those uniforms remind me of FMA.

RPG elements are also there, with terrain and personal special effects, experience development, special commands (Orders) from generals and such.

I don't enjoy real-time games that much I guess, paid $65 for Diablo 3 and this game is much more fun for me and cost me below $20.

*****
""A landmark first-person shooter""
While the gaming world is eagerly awaiting HALF-LIFE 2 and DOOM 3, the two guaranteed best-sellers in the coming months, it has just witnessed a landmark first-person action game that is sure to become one of the best games of the year.  Made by a German developer called Crytek, FAR CRY offers single-player action that is packed with excitement and ingenuity.  Even with the lack of a save-game feature (the game auto-saves for you occasionally), the superb level design, strong AI, the detailed and realistic graphics, and the perfect combination of stealth and action make FAR CRY the best actioner since DEUS EX and HALF-LIFE.
The story is just an obligatory pretext for the gameplay -- mad scientists, ruthless fighters and mercenaries, scientific experiments gone awry, and a tropical paradise becoming a living hell -- the kind of storyline that any casual sci-fi fan should be intimately familiar with, right down to the surprising villain at the end.  Much of the action takes place in a sunny tropical archipelago.  You play an ordinary guy named Jack Carver who is trapped on the islands and must fight his way out, with occasional help from two people, a scientist working on the islands and your female companion, Val, who is abducted at the start of the game.
The first striking thing about FAR CRY is its immensely large exterior locations.  Each map spans up to 1.2 km (3/4 mile), according to the designer, and much of it is accessible, from underwater to mountain tops, from one end of the map to the other.  The large exterior is also highly detailed, notably the jungle, the foliage, the tall grass, right down to the insects and birds.  And the water is the most realistic-looking I've ever seen.  There are many indoor locations as well.  Sometimes interior and exterior locations coexist on the same level -- you enter a huge exterior location, then go inside a building, then come back out to the same huge exterior.  FAR CRY has the most realistic and detailed game world I've ever seen.
To be sure, you need the latest and fastest PC and video card to see all the details.  With my P4 2.4 GHz and aging GeForce4 Ti4200, I have to set graphic details to medium to allow a playable frame rate of 20-40 fps, and that eliminates much of the environmental details, such as grass and insects.  Note that FAR CRY is only compatible with GeForce and Radeon video cards (it states so on the box).  One can download the playable demo from various sites, such as gamesdomain.com, to test your PC's ability.  The demo contains the entire second level of the game.  While FAR CRY is a game that is definitely worth upgrading your video card for, those who consider buying a GeForce4 FX or Radeon 9800 may want to wait a few weeks for a new batch of video cards, the NV40 from NVidia and the R420 from ATI.
The game also sounds terrific.  It supports quadraphonic (4 speakers), surround (5 speakers), and Dolby 5.1 (6 speakers) setup.  EAX (environmental audio effects) is also supported for Creative Audigy sound cards.  Basically, EAX is way of making remote audio sounds realistic.  For instance, when you eavesdrop someone in another room, his voice sounds a little farther away and also a little muffled or echo-y, depending on the distance and the acoustics of that room.  When you are underwater, you hear muffled sound from above the water.  Such audio realism helps you determine where the sound comes from.
The single-player portion of the game has one of the best AI I've ever seen.  In many ways the enemies are almost as smart as I am.  They can sneak up behind you, ambush you, snipe you, hide from you, run for cover, and alert others.  I detected no scripted AI, which means enemies don't behave the same way every time.  They can spot you from REALLY long distance, the same way you can.  Enemies range from the weak mercenaries, the sharp-shooting elite force with shields, to the tough, mutated animals called trigens.  Occasionally, you have to shoot down helicopters and other vehicles as well.
Given the strength of the AI, it is often best to surprise your enemies, and the game provides many means for stealthy gameplay.  You can use the surroundings to conceal yourself, such as crouching or lying prone behind bushes or tall grass.  You can use binoculars to spot enemies from hundreds of meters away.  You can use heat-sensing night-vision goggles to spot enemies (some of them invisible) in dark places.  Not to mention, you can engage in long-distance sniping -- and three of the weapons, thankfully, have telescopic view.  Refreshingly, the game only allows you to carry four weapons at a time.  So, be sure to keep one for sniping.
Of course, you can use brute force as well, especially in the later levels, when you are being hunted and have to engage your enemies head-on.  Two of the weapons can fire very damaging rockets and grenades, and they come in handy.  Not too surprisingly, these levels are the least interesting, and are unlike the earlier levels where stealth plays a bigger part.  With the lack of a save-game feature and a scarcity of health medikits and armor, you have often to die and replay the same level over and over.  The last level, in particular, is ridiculously difficult.  Interestingly, there are cheat codes available on the Internet that let you freely save your game.  That means the save-game feature is there in the game, but the designer chose to not let you use it.
But in spite of it all, the superb design of FAR CRY makes it a strong contender for action game of the year.",A landmark first-person shooter,1082937600,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The level design is interesting, but normally, I'd beat an act in under a minute. The graphics are also neatly detailed and not bad to look at. The sounds and music are good, but the music isn't memorable. Strangely, that also seems to go for Sonic Triple Trouble and Sonic Blast (two of the games that succeeded this).

What I find to be pretty cool are the item boxes that contain springs. As shown on the boxart, it's like bouncing as high as Mario with a pogo stick.

This game is a forgotten Sonic classic that deserves more attention. Heck, pretty much all of Sonic Game Gear games need as much attention. This game is as good as any 2D Sonic game out there.","More fast-paced action? Sure, why not?",1301011200,,,

5.0,False,"06 24, 2016",A1UQUDT2Q0YENM,B01CKGI0TO,Michael,"I'm enjoying the game because it's just so ridiculous. The bad guy shadows, the Mirages, are trying to steal the essence of your musical pop star power, your ""Perfoma"". To defeat the Mirages, you have to partner with ""Mirage Masters"". Of course the Mirage Masters are Fire Emblem characters. So this is a Atlus j-pop RPG. It's almost as if they took Dancing All Night without the rhythm game, mixed it with Persona, add real modern Japanese locations, and then threw in Fire Emblem Characters. And yes, there are j-pop music video cut scenes...

My game came in yesterday and I've got probably seven or eight hours in.

The Atlus RPG is much stronger than the Fire Emblem part. You do have the rock-paper-scissors circle of strong/weak from fire emblem in the battles, but the battles are all Atlus after that small addition. In the Persona games you partner and collect Personas. In this game you partner with Mirages from the Fire Emblem world. But like the Personas, the Mirages are more living tools your characters use rather than actual characters in the game. They do have some story in the cut scenes, but the game is really about the modern playable characters and those they're saving. Especially with the whole pop singing plot, I don't feel Fire Emblem. I not saying this is bad, but this is 90% Atlus rpg. It's much less of a mix than Persona Q was Persona and Etrian Odyssey mixed.

The battles are great. Since your Fire Emblem Battle partner is fixed, you don't collect Mirages. But you have more than just the three characters you take into battle and you can switch them in a battle turn. So you can bring in other teammates with different Mirage Masters. Your goal is to find attacks that are strong against your enemy and if you do your teammates will attack too. There's a real reason to know and use the battle advantages. There's an SP meter to fill during battle which can unleash ""Special Performances"".  Things are mixed up a bit as you get further, too.

The dungeons are ok. There are puzzles in the dungeons that can take backtracking. The puzzles are especially annoying when you go back to the dungeon for quests. The dungeons take place in another dimension while the over-world is modern Tokyo.

This game is in Japanese with subtitles. But the combat stuff isn't translated. To me this is the biggest loss. It's probably all fluff and repetitive interjections, but I guess I'll never know for sure... And I hear that some of the dialog is gameplay relevant, like a character letting you know they they their attack will be blocked or will miss in a chain attack.

I hear a lot of people are up in arms because there's censorship by Nintendo. There was some Hot Springs DLC in Japan with everybody in bathing suits that's completely gone. Bikini tops are less revealing throughout the game. I think the core game is here and I'm didn't come for fan-service so I'm ok with what I got. And it's weird to me because they didn't take out all the cleavage. I think the changes to the second level dungeon take away from the meaning, but other than that I'm not sure if I mind.

To me it's an rpg with an interesting story. The premises of bad guys stealing pop energy isn't deep, but it's fun. The battle system is great. The dungeon level design is ok. The cut scenes and overall style is great.

After buying several, we have landed on Turtle Beach as the superior brand for mid-level headsets ($40-$90) as they are well-constructed and sturdy and have great mics and headphones.  The Turtle Beach Ear Force Disney Infinity headset is another in Turtle Beach's line of superior electronics.

Although my 12 yr old and I were not interested in the ""Marvel Super Heroes"" marketing/decals that came with the headset (although I'm sure younger gamers would like the decals), we still found the appearance to be impressive and the headphone cups and headpiece are well padded.  Although the mic is overly large, it performs well and rotates 180 degrees to allow you to wear the mic on either your right or left side.  The headset itself expands enough to even allow it to fit on an adult.  The earcups have good ear coverage and again are large enough for an adult without it squishing your ears.

Since I used this on my PC, I had to use both the speaker cable, the mic cable, and the USB connector in order to power the headset.  The cord is SUPER long which is not really needed for my PC, but would be great for XBox, Playstation, or Wii gamers where the control box might be across the room.  The Turtle Beach Ear Force Disney Infinity comes with a cord-mounted control box that allows you easily adjust the game/headphone volume, the chat/mic output volume, the bass boost volume, and turn the mic on and off so you don't have to open up the PC speaker/mic controls in-game to adjust your game input/output which I thought was FANTASTIC!!!  There is nothing more irritating than to have to minimize your game screen and open up your volume control while game action is going on without you.

Overall, I found the Turtle Beach Ear Force Disney Infinity to be a superior piece of equipment even for the $70 list price.  My only minor complaint is that I prefer the single-ear headphone so that I can hear things around me (like my wife) and my son can hear my wife and I telling him that game time is done.

When I first started playing this game, I just had Diablo II, because the expansion hadn't come out yet.  In fact I had been playing atleast a year and a half by the time Lord of Destruction emerges.  And in that time I had had the greatest experience in my life.

At first I was just a lowely Barbarian, who wore a loin-cloth and hit monsters with my crappy axe.  But countless hours of online and offline play later, I was a badass looking barbarian with a thirst for blood.  And the online gaming is really where this game shines.  For one thing, Battle.net is free.  And another thing is that people don't just play this game online, they live it.  If my computer hadn't been total crap and stopped working, and I hadn't had to do other things, like go to work and try to maintain a relationship with actual people that I could touch and smell, then I would be going on my fourth year of playing this game.  But now that I have recently gotten back online and into the new wave of gamers, I am now, once again, completely addicted.

And when I say new wave of gamers, that's exactly what I mean.  Recently I was down at my local EB Games to pick up some games when I got into a conversation with the clerk there about Diablo II.  And for the first once, somebody actually knew where I was coming from.  You see, he had also played back in the old days before the expansion came out, and also noticed a difference in today's gamers.

For one thing, people nowadays want something from you, even if you have nothing.  For example, I was playing with my level 64 sorceress and I was searching all over the active channels looking for an item called a Lum Rune.  Finally, I came across a room with a lvl. 83 amazon who, when asked, told me she had three Lum Runes.  After seeing that I had nothing she wanted, she told me off and left the room.  I mean, come on!  Be nice, she had three and I had none.  She was like close to 30 levels ahead of me and couldn't spare to drop one of them.  Back in the day, people would make rooms just to drop things for free.  Of course back then almost everybody who was cool was a hacked character.  And things like elixers and the Jamella editor still existed.  Nowadays, people think being hacked means to have your stuff stolen.  No kids, that is getting screwed.  Getting hacked means you have acquired items from the games mainframe and are using them even though you aren't really supposed to for another 50 levels.  Being hacked meant you had everything you wanted and nobody was the wiser.

But anyway, about the expansion.  It introduces two new character classes, the Druid and the Assassin.  Making the total amount of playable characters seven (including the last game's Barbarian, Paladin, Necromancer, Sorceress, and Amazon).  Both of which are pretty cool characters.  Anyway, the game's praphics got touched up a bit, they are still sprites, but they fit the game perfectly.

I guess the one good thing about not having hacked cheater characters in the new version is you don't have to worry about anyone being invincible when you're dueling them (hacked characters tended to have something like 10 million hit points while the average player had less than a thousand).  So if you like your social life, steer clear of this drug, because once you're in, there's no telling when anybody will see you again.",the greatest game ever made,1094688000,2,,

5.0,False,"04 24, 2008",APZC5PRJVM0PY,B000TG530M,JD,"I've held off a long time on my review because I wanted to include a fair amount of Live play in my review as that seems to be a big selling point for this game.

But Singleplay first:

Call of Duty 4 is a very, very good game.  Hands down this is one of the best games I've played on Xbox 360 and ranks right up there with Bioshock for sheer fun and quality.  CoD4 has a good story and decent voice acting but not to the degree that you find in games like Bioshock.  But at its core CoD4 is a first-person shooter and Bioshock wasn't your typical shooter (not a bad thing mind you).  If you dwell too long on the story of CoD4 you may find faults with it so I don't stress it as a game selling point - it is good, but not great.  With CoD4 it is all about the action.  Unlike many of the first-person shooters I've struggled with in the past the graphic quality of this one is amazing and that makes it a lot less frustrating to play - anyone who has struggled to discern the snipers blending into the pixel nightmare of early shooter games will know what I mean.  In CoD4 the graphics are pristine and smooth and very realistic.  There is a fair amount of texture recycling and the like and if you've seen a couple maps you've seen the extent of what you are likely to see terrain/clutter wise, but man, they are sure pretty.  The forests and skies, as well as the closeup detail on uniforms and weapons is exceptional.  Even ground clutter like grass and foliage is better than I have seen before and you can and move and discern targets from the graphics with ease allowing you to focus on firefights and not on trying to find a target to shoot at before they see you.  You may still struggle to find them at times though, as the shadows and ground clutter congestion are also very good - especially in multiplayer.

Multiplayer:

So how is the multiplayer? I think it is very good.  I was much more impressed with CoD4 online than say any of the Halo series.  I think the weapon damage is much more realistic in CoD4 with less emphasis on how weak one weapon is vs. how powerful another weapon is (think the pistol and the sniper rifle in Halo vs. the assault rifle).  In CoD4 I found it matters less what weapon one was using and more on how they are using the weapon.  Usually situational awareness and accuracy will save the day regardless of the weapon you are using.  Also, each play style, and some maps, call for specific weapons.  You don't want a weapon with slow reloads or small magazines in close quarters combat, nor do you want an inaccurate submachine gun on open maps where your gun will be much less effective at range.

I also found that there was less of a disparity among those who play all the time and the casual player than many other multiplayer games.  Unfortunately, I think this has to do with CoD4's nature of rewarding ""camping"" players, that is players who set up ambush points and wait forever for someone to cross their paths instead of mixing it up in the firefights.  CoD4 has a lot of potential choke points where a single sniper or someone with a great submachine gun and some mad skills can stave off countless attackers.  That can be really frustrating, but as the maps are open and spawning appears somewhat random the tables can be easily turned on your opponent if you choose to do the same - although rewarded for doing this in the game mechanics this makes for slow, painful and often upsetting matches.

CoD4 offers players ""perks"" that can be equipped and more are available for unlocking when certain levels or skill challenges are unlocked.  While they don't turn the tide of the game often they do come in handy or exceptionally frustrating depending upon the situation.  At first I found these fun, but as time went on I found they would get more and more annoying as certain perks can make it harder to setup certain traps on opposing forces or make the enemy much harder to spot and kill in certain circumstances.  Sometimes the perks you equip will give you an edge, but also having the wrong perk at the wrong time can be frustrating.

For players with enough skills to rack up a number of enemy kills without dying (3/5/7 in a row) there are additional perks in the form of radar, air strikes and air support (attack helicopter) that benefit the whole team.  While it is frustrating not to be able to call these in yourself because you may not be the best player out there it is nice that they are an asset that the whole team can share in.

All in all the multiplayer was fast and frantic most of the time with intense firefights and fast respawns and was a real blast even if I'm not very good at it.  If you have a team that likes to work together and take their time you can also enjoy team tactics setting up choke points, assaults and defensive scenarios, etc. where everyone can work together to accomplish a goal.  I found that when a team was willing to work together than they could really decimate the competition but most of the time it is more free-for-all - still good and intense if a bit less effective and less rewarding.

I have had a moment or two of lag but have not had the scenarios that other people have complained of where constant lag is upsetting the game play.  Perhaps they have internet problems or they just play so much they see it and I don't.  If I had any complaints it is that players aren't evenly matched up, often a new player is pitted against people with a disparative skill level and that makes play frustrating and people aren't very forgiving to players of lesser skill.  I guess for some people they can't understand that this is just a game and any ""reward"" is only what you take away from your time playing.

EDIT:  In regards to the online play I wanted to add an additional update.  As others have said (and I originally dismissed) there are some quirks with the online play.  Call it ""lag"" for lack of a better term.  I've noticed situations where I've fired my weapon (especially noticeable with sniper weapons) and nothing happens, the bullet never appears and never strikes the target.  It is bizarre.  Also, when you view the 'kill cam' showing you being gunned down you can see that what you were seeing and what the opposing player was seeing are not the same.  For example, I've fired into an approaching opponent and been killed only to watch the kill cam and notice that it doesn't show me shooting at all.  Genuinely weird and more than a little annoying.","Very, very good",1208995200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

You take charge of a small tropical island as El Presidente, and it's up to you to figure out just how you're going to keep things running smoothly. Will you support the island economy through mining? Farming? Tourism? Will you strive to keep your citizens happy by offering them tax cuts and free housing, or will you just outlaw elections and surround your office with military bases in an attempt to thwart the monthly assassination attempts.

The game's visuals are amazing. Every little detail is animated, and a great deal of time can be spent just ""flying"" over your island watching people go about their day. You can highlight any citizen and see their job, education, family tree, beliefs, and even their thought process. You may find several people upset that there are no luxury stores around, which lets you know to build a shopping mall that caters to high-end customers. You can also, if so desired, mark a random rebel or criminal to be arrested, assassinated or just to ""have an accident"".

As beautiful as the game is, its real appeal is deep within the mechanics that keeps everything running. Everything in Tropico is connected in one way or another. Building logging camps is a quick way to boost the economy and provide jobs, but angers environmentalists. Shallow displays of patriotism impresses the uneducated, but bothers the intellectuals. Quite a few times, you'll find that your island dwellers need healthcare and education, but the buildings will remain unoccupied until you find qualified staff to run them. Building a solid base early on is essential to a productive island later on.

The music is catchy and infectious, but is way too short. The soundtrack is an earworm of the worst kind, and it's gotten to the point where I had to mute the music and start playing my own.

The reason I picked this up for console again was so I could enjoy the vanilla experience on my TV and PS Vita without having to worry about the issues that haunt the modded PC version.

This is a huge improvement over the PS3 version in so many ways. Do not listen to anyone that tells you it doesn't look any different; they are likely comparing it to the modded PC version. Watch a side-by-side video of PS3/PS4 and you will see. So far I've had a great experience with this game with only two complaints.

Pros:
-Performance has been great so far. No stutter/FPS drops, no flickering or bad shadows, no crashes, no major glitches (playing on PS4 Slim)
-Huge improvement from the atrocious, flickering shadow mess that was PS3
-Mostly the same great game it was before, with the majority of the issues taken out
-Ability to have mods
-A few new QoL additions, such as saves organized per character
-Improved sound quality (PS4 ONLY)

Cons:
-$60 is a bit steep
-Motion blur still in first-person and can't be disabled, as far as I can tell
-PS4 mods are more limited at the moment

If you've never played Skyrim, you should definitely pick up this copy. If you have it on a high-end PC and it is heavily modded, PS4 version isn't an improvement unless you just want to play it on console.

Winter of 2008 came, and nada. It had been delayed, and since since, Max Payne 3 has been delayed more times than I can count, but finally! It is here. This game is great, plain and simple. Bullet time is back and more epic than ever. Seeing that final bullet completely rip apart your enemy in a bloody gorey fashion is sickly satisfying. The controls are a little tricky at first, but you should get the hang of it after an hour of play or so. You might have to refer to your booklet a few times, but you can do it!

The gameplay is much more fluid than previous titles obviously. Now when you dive and your close to a wall or an open door, you make contact with it, you just don't simply float around it. Like in real life, you die with just a few shots, and head shots in this one mean instant death, and that's including you, so you can't always just run and gun. You have to take cover and strategize. As for weapons management, you have a wheel that you can bring up in game with 4 slots. 2 for handguns, one for a larger weapon such as a shotgun, and the other slot is for dual wielding the two handguns. The graphics are beautiful, an easy 9/10. Everything is finely detailed. This game also has absolutely excellent sound. The guns actually sound like REAL guns, go figure. The voice acting is some of the best I've heard in a video game ever, and did I mention you get to kill guidos? YES! You can now kill your very own Jersey Shore look alikes in what I believe is chapter 4. This game is worthy for purchase solely on that premise. The only negative thing I can really think of is really subjective to the player. This is a heavy cut scene game, and they disguise the loading times. I'd much rather watch that as opposed to a black loading screen.

As for the multiplayer, it's effing addicting. I was expecting something a bit meh to be honest. Team deathmatch is a blast. You can level up, purchase weapons and accessories that aid you in combat, such a vest, helmets that reduce damage taken etc. I highly recommend you pick this up.",One of the best games of 2012,1338336000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This is a remarkable achievement and I think so even though I understand criticisms on how this is not a game, but a playable novel. I absolutely adored The Last of Us - and I adore Beyond Two Souls specifically for the same reason: STORY.

Character, story and emotional depth in this game is unlike anything I have seen. The game recaptures a dying art, truly - and makes story and characters relevant again. Remember why 8-bit games of 1980s were more fun than 1920x1800 HD games of today? They couldn't dazzle with graphics, so they had to focus on story, characters and emotional reality (not factual, or graphic reality).

Yet, I have to tell you the game has some of the best graphics I have seen on PS3 platform; visuals, shading - and oh my god, camera angles (cinematography) are top quality. Visuals of this game is pure artistic genius. It really is a playable novel, with cinema-artistic qualities on par with top movie productions.

I could easily list this game at the Top 3 of best PS3 games I have played.

Downsides that really doesn't make this game a lesser game:

- Not actually a game - your decisions don't really have much impact on playing experience. The upcoming sequel can retain artistic aspects of this and build on it by developing a kick-ass engine in Aiden engine, shooting, stealth, movement etc. to make it more of a game-novel combination.

- You don't die, really. So you can't make much of a mistake in the game. I think game could be developed further in that aspect and carry on into different outcomes as you get wounded, killed etc.

- Very linear story line. A combination of more fluid story telling, plus sandbox experience will be really amazing.

If all three shortcomings can be improved in the next sequel (not DLC, an actual new game as sequel), this came can truly become one of the best games of all time, in all platforms.",Brings back the lost art of gaming: STORY and CHARACTERS,1390694400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

I agree with the other 2 reviews posted to date. Just purchased it, have played for 2 hours, and will update this ASAP.  It's a fun game with very good graphics.  I have not read the directions yet, (like to jump in and play first), and found swinging confusing until I realized how it works.  You lift your club until the blue line on the power bar, equals the distance you need to drive. Totally different than Wii golf, and should not be confused with a real golf match game.  However, there is enough golf, and interesting scenery, to satisfy my desire for a second game. This game is a sleeper, and will get much more playing time than some other titles I have reviewed.

While Miis are not used, the characters are a definite plus. They are lifelike humans, rather than cartoonish. When you have some winnings, you take your character to the clubhouse, and dress them as you like. The costumes range from conservative to highly suggestive.  I wasn't able to purchase the new clothing, but I was able to change my character into the different outfits.  Initially, you only have a choice of 2 characters. I am using Hanah, a cute and personable girl of about 20. She has a cute voice. Based on my initial 3 hole practice round (done 4 times until my first birdie), I expect to put quite a few hours on this game.

This is my update.  I have now read the directions.  Marginal help.  Then I went through the tutorial again.  I was making a lot of mistakes.  You need to go through the tutorial a second time.  It means more after you have played. You can change the direction of your putts and drives, just like Wii golf.  The special shots are fun. I just finished 3 more hours of play.  The game is addictive, once you understand it. You have to like humor. I like Rayman Rabbits.  I think 8 years and up is an appropriate age level. Girls 8+ will especially like the different costumes and accessories available.  Boys will just like the game play. It's also great for adults.  I'm a retiree.  The key is to go through the tutorial several times. Once before you play. then at least once after you have played for 1-2 hours. I was initially frustrated before I went back to the tutorial.

I don't think I'll ever be getting bored with it. If you like Grand Theft Auto IV and westerns, such as myself, you'll be in heaven. Even if you don't care for either of those, the story, characters, locations, and breathtaking graphics will draw almost anyone in. To top it all off, RDR features a massive environment and at least 20 hours of gameplay in single player mode. Aside from the main missions, you can play poker, hunt and skin animals, herd cattle, train horses, kill good or bad guys (depending on if you're taking the hero or outlaw route), duel some unlucky fellow, take on various side quests, or just ride around the gorgeous landscape for hours on end.

The graphics and sound are top of the line, even with some minor visual glitches here and there. The voice acting here can't be beat. If you have played the GTA games, the controls here are pretty much the same. Riding a horse can take awhile to master, but I now ride it like a real cowboy.

Red Dead Redemption is the best way to experience the wild west. Sure, watching a western movie has it's own rewards, but with this game you actually feel like you're a part of this time in history.

The games he creates are often so addictive they should be considered controlled substances, and PIRATES! is no exception. I originally bought this game for my girlfriend, who is pirate-crazy, but after seeing how fun it was, got a copy for myself. That was a black day for my productivity as a human being.

PIRATES! proceeds from a simple premise, to wit, you're a pirate. Naturally that means you sail the Carribean in search of illicit loot, but there's more to the game than just hunting down treasure galleons. It actually has a plot, as well as a number of features which expand somewhat on the obvious motive of high-seas robbery. It would take me quite a while to explain everything, so I'm going to stick to describing how you will spend your time when you're playing:

First, you'll troll the seas looking for ships of the French, Dutch, English and Spanish which to rob. The number and type of ships is pretty impressive, from lightning-fast sloops to lumbering royal galleons, and they all have different fighting and maneuvering capabilities. Specialized ""pirate hunter"" vessels make your life even more interesting. Sea combat is one way of taking or sinking the enemy's ship, but failing that, you can always board her and elect to fight sword-to-sword. Speaking of that, you'll spend a lot of time clashing blades with fellow pirates, enemy sailors, wanted criminals, jealous fiances and similar scalliwags.

In additon to robbing ships, you can also raise small armies of men and assault the various coastal cities from shore, putting your buccaneers up against the Indian mercenaries and soldiers of the great powers. Holding towns hostage is a lucrative if dangerous way to make a livin'.

A major factor in the game is romance, specifically your attempts to win the affections of various governor's daughters (""Give up the booty!""), in return for information or valuable items. This is done by showing `em your moves on the dance floor, and many people consider this (rightly) to be the most difficult aspect of the game.

One of many quests is for items to make you a more effective pirate, such as better swords, dancing shoes, ruby rings, fencing shirts, skeleton keys, etc. Some of these you will receive as gifts from female admirers, others as bribes from criminals you've caught, and others you'll have to buy.

When you're not doing all this, you're probably pieceing together treasure maps to locate the buried loot of rival pirates, or else hunting down your kidnapped relatives, or trying to locate lost Incan cities full of treasure. It's a full schedule.

If all this sounds complicated, it isn't. The game is so intuitive that mine didn't even come with an instruction manual. It's a very basic, straightforward concept - hunt for treasure, romance chicks, hunt down your enemies and rescue your loved ones, in whatever order of priority you desire. Continuing the motif of simplicity, the game is graphically colorful and appealing, but makes no attempt to ""wow"" the player; the emphasis, as on CIVILIZATION, is not on bells and whistles but on playability. PIRATES! has some rather aggravating drawbacks and a glitch or two (see other reviews), but they don't effect its addictive quality, which is ""crack-like""...even if you're not pirate-crazy.",Argh!,1320796800,,,

5.0,False,"03 20, 2003",A116ZSMZRT9RUN,B00000K4AX,David Noelle,"System Shock 2 is hard to categorize, because it blends several genres and styles of games so well. It's a Role-Playing First-Person Shooter Science Fiction Survival/Horror game, with some extra twists here and there. If you wished Half-Life was more like Deus Ex, or you wanted to play the more violent and scary parts of Thief with 22nd century firepower, this is the game you want to play.
Though it's getting a bit dated now, this game was far enough ahead of its time to still be very playable. Where the original System Shock made history as a remarkably immersive story-driven first-person shooter, the sequel goes even further with complex character development elements usually only seen in role-playing games. The graphics scale up smoothly enough to still look impressive on today's faster, higher resolution (and higher polygon count) displays, the sound is of sufficient quality to still be just as effective as most newer, more technically advanced productions, and of course, a great story is never obsolete.
Once you get into a game this immersive, you forget about the technical details that may no longer be as cutting-edge as they once were. Just turn off the lights, plug in your headphones (or surround-sound if you have it), and try to stay alive. If you happen to forget that it's just a game, this one can really scare you. Definitely not for the faint of heart.
The biggest flaw in this game is that the developers just didn't have enough time to fully flesh-out and polish some of the later parts. Certain areas are just less expansive and detailed and finely-tuned than others. The game doesn't significantly suffer from what's missing. It just could have been that much better.
By far the most common complaint about this game is that the weapons break too fast. Personally, I don't consider that a flaw. I like the extra stress factor of having to keep an eye on the condition of my weapons. Unlike most First-Person Shooters, your resources are very limited in this game. Throughout most of the game, you will very rarely have enough ammo to stop worrying about making every shot count. There are a limited number of weapons available, and if you keep firing one until it jams, you have to either expend other resources to fix it or deal with the fact that you have one less gun to work with.
If you really don't like worrying about broken weapons, there is a way to reduce or completely disable weapon deterioration. It's not a menu option you can switch on and off within the game, but the release notes file on the CD explains how to do it, and it's not difficult.
One complaint I've heard about the end of this game is that there are two ""final battles"" at the end, and the second one is disappointingly easy. I didn't feel that way because I recognized that the first final battle was the climax, and then when there was one more confrontation after that, I thought of it as more of an epilogue than a challenge. This is something gamers just aren't used to, and the only other game I've played that had an ""epilogue"" after the final confrontation was Half-Life, which has been accused of having the worst ending of any game ever. The ending of System Shock 2 isn't nearly that bad, but it can be disappointing if the relatively short final areas have left you expecting more.
Unfortunately, due to the particular circumstances of the closing of the company that developed the game, Looking Glass Studios, it is very unlikely that there will ever be a third System Shock game.",Still one of the best games I've ever played.,1048118400,4,,

Bigger, meaner, and more epic than either of its predecessors Dark Souls 2 represents a stunning achievement in design and execution. It welcomes new players with a friendlier tutorial and improved mechanics, but veterans of the Souls series need not be worried. Dark Souls 2 is brutal and challenging, testing you every step of the way with tough bosses and overwhelming odds. But Dark Souls 2 is also beautiful and stunning, featuring a world that is well worth exploring every nook and cranny, from dark and dead pits to harrowing civilizations long lost in time above the clouds. Dark Souls 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece, through and through.

Story, Presentation, and World  10/10/10  10

The story of Dark Souls 2 is a fantastical tale of kingdoms lost in time, ruled by monsters and hostile forces ready to challenge the player. Similar to the previous games, Dark Souls 2 is a mildly minimalistic game in terms of delivering information; the player must explore and discover most of the world himself or herself. Its an impressive story and world, with a staggering amount of thought behind its deep lore and characters. Its a world filled with mystery, where the players imagination is key to understanding and connecting the loose ties between characters and their place in Drangleic. And Im sure the ending will be something discussed by Souls fans for years to come.
Dark Souls 2 also features a significant upgrade in presentation values. Things are cleaner, nuanced elements in character building are more clear and menus are designed with a greater emphasis on ease of use. Its all still very much like the previous games, just refined and improved to perfection.

Graphics and Art Direction  9/10  9.5

The world of Drangleic is an epic land ripe for exploration. Half of this experience, though, is the staggeringly huge variety of places youll visit while on your quest. Decrepit crypts, castles in the sky, and even the garbage bin of Drangleic itself, the art direction for Dark Souls 2 continues the FromSoftwares creative trend in developing horrendous creatures and placing them in a fascinating world. There are tons of unique bosses and enemies out for your hollow head, and each and every one is animated with a certain professionalism only a Japanese studio could produce. Along with these disturbing denizens of Drangleic, the places youll visit are equally impressive; not simply because of their design but also the character, increased color pallet and pure imagination every new area brings. To say that Dark Souls 2s art direction is great would be a crime; it is simply stunning, and is one of a kind.
Graphically, Dark Souls 2 is superior to its predecessors in many ways. Youll be happy to know that the game runs at a steady 30 FPS throughout (PS3) to 60 FPS (360 version is more consistently smoother, PS3 does hit 60 FPS in enclosed and small areas) and technically performs without a hitch. The big improvement here is the animations, which have benefited immensely from being motion captured. Elements of your character react with realism, and enemies feel lifelike and move like they should. The improved lighting engine creates a surprising sense of immersion (although is not the lighting engine we were advertised last year), and the improved physics engine is icing on the cake (characters armor, such as loincloths and hoods flow in the wind and react realistically). Grainy textures and anti-aliasing problems do occur more often than I wouldve like to see (and are simply limitations of the Xbox 360 and PS3). The dumbed down lighting engine is a disappointment as well as the grainy textures and various visual hiccups, making a next gen version of Dark Souls 2 all the more tantalizing.

Gameplay and Design  10/10  10

Where as Demons Souls introduced us to the impossibly challenging difficulty the series is known for and Dark Souls improved the online and flow of combat, Dark Souls 2 has perfected what the series is known for. Tight and claustrophobic combat headlines the game, while rewarding exploration, online PvP, summoning and aiding other players are all improved. Dark Souls 2 continues the trend of endless tactics with the numerous amount of weapons, which all feel distinct and fun to use. Everything has been improved, refined, and polished. The classic gameplay is still as challenging as ever, too. Fears of Dark Souls 2 dumbing down the difficulty and level of challenge have gone completely unwarranted. If anything, this may be the most challenging of all the Souls games, but also the most fair. Yes, youll die, get punished because of it, and lose your souls (which can be retrieved within the next life) and your human status, if you're human. But Dark Souls 2, unlike its previous entries, clearly explains the effects of items, materials, and penalties. You die because you're unfamiliar with a boss, area, or unique enemy tactic. You only come back stronger, more aware of the dangers you will face and more capable to tackle them quicker with more precision. Of the 245 times I died through my play-through, I rarely felt cheated. Only a few times (fighting optional bosses and online PvP) did I feel this way.
In terms of design, Dark Souls 2 is built with the player in mind. Beginning the adventure is tough, as is every video game. Healing items are rare in the beginning, and the Estus Flask only offers a swig at first. But as you explore this hostile and beautiful world, youll be rewarded with new and better armors, lifegems, status ailment healers, new weapons and sometimes the rare shards to improve the Estus Flask. Exploration doesnt get more rewarding than this. Dark Souls 2 also offers a huge collection of memorable boss battles; everything from quick thinking to pure dodging skill is required throughout the many, many bosses that stand in your way. And you will take them all out, I believe in you! Dark Souls 2 is rewarding every step of the way; from its improved, tighter combat, intricate level design and unique character building this is an RPG that sacrifices nothing its famous for, but rather embraces its flaws and only improves upon them.

Sound Design and Soundtrack  9/10  9.5

Dark Souls 2 will immerse you in more ways than one, and thats mainly because of its subtle sound design. Some say the best sound design is one that you don't even notice; Dark Souls 2 is accomplished in this aspect. Swords will clash and spells will be cast, and they all sound great. The ambience while exploring each area really shines brightly as well. From creepy distant cackles to hollow and decrepit crypts, everything sounds as it should. Voice acting, a small part of all the Souls games, has been improved and expanded here and it is all delivered very well.
Dark Souls 2 features, hands down, the best score for any of the Souls games. Each boss fight has its own unique theme, memorable and musical enough to listen to outside the game. The tragic and intense orchestration and score really highlights each boss fight, making each an assault on the senses and emotions (and the emotional depth of the soundtrack itself is stunning). And don't worry, the classic finale aria is beautiful and thoroughly composed with a purpose. Mr. Motoi Sakruaba, take a bow.

Lasting Appeal  10

Unlike previous Souls games, once the credits roll there is still more to do. An altered new game plus allows people to continue to explore past the credits which is excellent for those who want to continue their adventure and clear optional areas. The game does have the classic new game plus, though, in which you do less damage while enemies do more. There are multiple new challenges that await players in new game plus, all of which require new tactics and skills. Aside from that, players can re-spec their characters to try different builds, join and work through multiple covenants, beat optional bosses and work your way through PvP. Dark Souls 2 offers a lot to do post-credits.

Final Score - 10/10

Dark Souls 2 took me just about 52 hours to complete (final time - 51:50) and I died 245 times. Oddly enough, though, every minute within this world was incredible. Drangleic is a gorgeous and oddly inviting world to explore, and your adventure will take you to the far corners of this hostile place, fighting off monsters and battling players along the way. It was an immensely satisfying and enjoyable game, and most of all it felt incredibly fair the entire way through. It is not only one of the best games I have ever played, but it gives reasons for video games to exist. Only in video games can you receive the same sense of exploration and discovery that Dark Souls 2 offers, and thats why its such a grand masterpiece and a testament to video games as a medium.

Guys, listen up. This is a good game. I would recommend it. However, it is not the best.
-

Plot: Sonic encounters a strange monster late one night in Station Square, which had previously been released by Dr. Eggman from Knuckles' Master Emerald. Eggman plans to conquer the world with this liquid creature known as Chaos, the God of Destruction. Over the next few days, Sonic joins forces with his good buddy Tails, his rival Knuckles, his stalker Amy, to take down the beast as it grows to City-Destroying proportions. Along the way two other (new) characters, E-102 Gamma, an Eggman robot gone rogue, and Big, a dumb cat who lives a simple existence, are pulled into the fray.
Sounds good, doesn't it? The plot it probably as good as it gets, with plenty of plot-branching outwards, as you can see Amy work to try and find flickies, Knuckles restore his Emerald, Gamma's mission to kill other Eggman bots, and Tails even experiences his own adventure. I think Sonic Adventure 2's plot is better, as it has a dark side to it, but this is nice also.
-

Controls: I'm not going into this again. My Sonic Adventure 2 Battle review covers the controls fine.
-

Gameplay: The Game-play is hit and miss. Tails, Amy, Sonic, and Gamma have the best game-play and level style. Sonic needs to get to the end of the level as fast as he can, and boy, is he fast, uncontrollably so! I have gone so fast that the game has thrown Sonic out of the levels. That is how much speed he has! Tails is somewhat slower, but he can fly and skip huge portions of levels. That is great, because his levels are basically race Sonic/Eggman to the end of the level. Gamma is a shooting-style railer, but he needs to run against the clock. As the clock counts down, he needs to shoot as many enemies as possible to earn time. At the end of all of his levels are bosses (Except for Emerald Coast), which he has to kill in a certain time frame. Amy is slow compared to Sonic and Tails, and has the same level style, get to the goal ring, but the entire time is chased by a robot known as E-100 Alpha aka Zero. This robot will try to kill you. This gets the adrenaline going and your mind going, considering how you need to outsmart the robot and every turn of the level!

Then you come to Knuckles. He needs to find 3 Master Emerald Shards. Simple? I think not. His levels and controls are pretty darn glitchy, and sometimes the shards are put in impossible places. This can be Rage-inducing. Thankfully, the control system was fixed in Sonic Adventure 2, however, the radar is better in this game.

And lastly: Big. DIE YOU STUPID CAT! Basically, he's super-slow (Yet he climbs ladders fast), has to go to a level, find his stupid frog, and fish for it. TOTAL 180 degrees from what a Sonic game should be. This is very rage-inducing, as the fishing controls are pretty darn close to being broken. The only upside is that some of Big's levels have cool special sections that only he can access. Praise the God/gods you serve that he was not included in any other game outside of Sonic (Z)Heroes.
-

Re-playability: When you first start the game, you won't want to put it down until you have found out everything about the character's story and side of the events. But after finishing the game, it near totally loses replay value, even with all the missions you can do and the Game-Gear games you can unlock. Even if you earn all 130 emblems, which is harder then it was in Sonic Adventure 2 somehow, you unlock Metal Sonic playability, and he plays the same as Sonic, just slower.
-

Multiplayer: Null, unless you want to a second person to control Tails in Sonic's levels. Yes, that can be done, but Tails will usually drop off of the camera considering Sonic's speed.
-

Final Judgement: This game is something I would recommend, but is it worth paying 60 or more dollars for? No. Not worth it. I paid 30 dollars for this if memory serves right, and considering the game, I think it's not worth more then Forty. As opposed, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, I would pay 100 dollars for that game. This one gets old fast, and although it is good for any collector, it's not a game that you will be pulling out all of the time once finished.
I'd give it a 3.5/5, or a 7/10. I would recommend this to anyone on any system, but only if for a good price.","A Good Port of a Great Game, but it's not 'excellent'!",1352160000,,,

Following up on the success of their CPS 1 System based fighter ""Street Fighter"" and the CPS 2 system based Street Fighter II and similar titles, Capcom decided to push their development capabilities to the limit and publish Street Fighter Alpha for the Sony Playstation. Being that the PS1 is not designed for graphic intensive 2D games, Capcom did a great job of porting this game over with very minimal loss on the frames of animation on the screen. Moves are pulled off fluidly and there are no issues of slowdown whatsoever in this game. You can even choose between the original arcade sound track to the game or a remixed sound track that makes the game sound more interesting.

I got it the day of release. Pop in the disc and took a deep breath before embarking on solid snake's final mission of his life. I remembered getting myself into the training portion of the game learning the controls and getting used to the new old snake's movements before starting the game and it has paid off tremendously. I knew this was a game in its own turf and what an epic porportion this is. I have played all the other metal gear games in the series so I know whos who in the storyline. This game is developed with the fans in mind as all the old characters shows up for a final battle. I now love old snake so much compare to when he was young. It just fits so well. All of us who played the other metal gear games from the early days have aged as well so when you play old snake it has a deep connection to him and it just flows so well. Snake is wiser, gained a tremendous amount of knowledge thruout his life as I have. I felt I was controlling myself in the game. The graphics, sound, gameplay and storyline is top notch especially when you play it on a HDTV. This game is immersive and intense as the story builds up. One by one all old charaters in the series emerges and it really touches you emotionally. They have changed quite a bit since the last chapter where they were introduced. So fans of the series really cared about them and it will stir your emotion while playing the game. I remembered I got really immersed in the game in one of the chapters towards the end that I weep and cried. I couldn't believe I was in tears. No game has ever stir my emotions so much in a game. Anyone who has yet to play this game should play the other metal gear games in the series before diving into this one. If you just play MGS4 without a clue of whos who and what's going on it will not have any effect on you. To fully get the impact this game project one must play the earlier games. I am grateful for the creater Hideo Kojima for an incredible experience. No other game has moved me so much. There are also a lot of cut scenes in order to tie in all the loose ends of the storyline and every metal gear fans should already expect this to be part of the package.

Those who have used the Super Nintendo's Super Gameboy accessory should already be familiar with this concept, where it puts your games on screen with a border around it.  Gameboy Advance games can be run full screen with a resolution that is similar to Super Nintendo.  This also allows you to play Gameboy Color games - something Super Gameboy couldn't do.

I was impressed that the included a link port, which adds some interesting possibilities.  Also, the low profile of the bttm piece doesn't really make the Gamecube that much taller or change its look that much.  The player allows you to swap games while the console remains on (using the button in the Z menu first).  There is a motion smoothing feature that subtly tunes up your GBA games.  There are also several screen format options which is helpful when working with different TV's.

So why would you want this?  I own three handhelds that can play GBA games, I didn't get this because I needed another device to play on.  These games are visually designed for small screens and sometimes this doesn't translate well to the big screen.  But there are two areas I really think this can shine:

Strategy games play well on a bigger screen.  I'd been stuck for months on Advance Wars, but somehow seeing it on the big screen, the solution just clicked.  I imagine this will be the same in other strategy games.

Recording gameplay footage.  I personally dislike emulators and think that this is the only real option for faithfully recording gameplay for GBC and GBA games.

Sea dogs makes a valiant effort, though not succeeding on every point.  For those who enjoyed Sid Meyer's Pirates, like myself, you may find a few things lacking in Sea Dogs. The setting is an imaginary group of islands, not the Caribbean as I had hoped. The number of visitable islands is also fairly limited.  The towns you can visit are pretty, but limited in their scope.  Gameplay is limited to one character so I don't believe this is a true RPG, but the game does deal in experience points, hit points and skill points in your character's progression. This game does have a steep learning curve, with novices getting blasted out of the water on a regular basis.  So why did I give this game 5 stars? The sailing sequences are breathtaking with beautiful waves, ships, and environmental effects. Battling other ships and forts is also great 3d fun and the gameplay in between is solid enough to keep me playing again and again (much to the irritation of my wife).

The environment of the game is astoundingly detailed with 3D background effects, including moving objects in full 3D and the creativity involved in developing the enemies make it that much easier to immerse yourself in this wonderful complete fantasy world, and escaping reality. With that being said, seeing that this game was directly influenced by Super Metroid, and perhaps some of the other Nintendo entries to the series, I must say that the Metroid-style gameplay was executed beautifully with all kinds of different suits (or cloaks) you can pick up, fluid controls, and an absolutely fantastic soundtrack that fits each and every one of its perspective environments the tracks were made for. Another excellent aspect of this game is the idea of leveling up your character to increase stats and such. That was beautifully implemented, rewarding you with easier gameplay if you destroy enough enemies and find the most powerful cloaks and weapons you can find in the game. You can also acquire various transformations that will turn your character into either a bat, a purple wolf, or simply a handful of mist, so you can pass through obstacles that were blocked before. Overall, this game is the most groundbreaking entry of the series, and it is one that I would not mind playing again and again, as the gameplay is as versatile as it gets with these style of games.",Most Solid Entry to the Series,1400976000,,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},

Pros:
Great graphics!
Good storyline and villain
Still feels like FC3
Depth of field is really well done

Cons:
30 fps. Come on Ubi...
I personally liked the beachy feel that FC3 had and I don't feel as much of that in this game
Online still isn't that great. (Who saw that one coming?!)

I have NEVER seen a game better than this before and oh my if you don't have a wii u this game is worth the $350 alone! If you do have a wii u.... what are you waiting for!?!?! Anyway lets dive into the review-

Graphics: Folks graphics don't make a game. But Pikmin 3 has the best graphics I have ever seen in my life; and I have a high end PC. Its so colorful, so sharp! Watching a video on youtube or any other site doesnt do this game justice. You need to play it yourself to see the beauty.

Audio: The music sets the tone of this game so well its unbelievable. Its so calm and relaxed until you get into a fight where the music will pick up its tone. Its just.... great.

Story: The story is 3 people trying to explore a planet have crash landed in different places. Once they get up they find weird creatures. Pikmin. Using the pikmin they must gather food to survive. I won't spoil any more of the plot because it's just too good.

Length/Replay value.

The game took me about 15 hours for the main story but more fun lies in the Missions and Bingo Battle. Bingo Battle is a great multiplayer mode, and trying the leaderboards can get addicting. Lets go back for a second though, I picked this game up at midnight on the eshop- okay. Wait its midnight of the next day (as of the time of writing this review). Yes this game is SOOO addicting that in the first day the game sucked up 18 hours of my life, and I haven't even gone for 100%, played many matches of bingo mode, Completed nearly any of the challenges. And I'm hungry for way more pikmin 3. This alone should tell you that this... is a great one.

Gameplay: The gameplay of this game is simple: Gather pikmin, Collect fruit to survive, Defeat enemies to gather more pikmin, and explore as much as you can in a day. The game works of a day system. Every day is 13 minutes, if you never stop the game and look around the map with the gamepad and such. Its a lot more useful than it sounds and is currently the best use of the gamepad in a game just being a map! But this isn't your old typical wii u map its a lot better. Just play the game and see for yourself. There are 3 control methods for this game; Gamepad, Pro Controller and wiimote+. The wiimote+ is easilly by far the best way to play this game but the gamepad and Pro Controller work well too. And for those wondering no- gamepad features aren't exclusive to when your playing with the gamepad. The map still shows if your playing with the wiimote+ or the Pro Controller.

Verdict:
This game is amazing. I can't think of a single flaw it has- and I'm not one to give games perfect scores. This is a game to be remembered and is in my opinion, the best game of all time. Buy a wii u and this game now.","Somehow, flawless",1375660800,4,,

For starters, the main function of the game is the rhythm game, where you play different songs with different characters, at different difficulty levels. If you've played any rhythm games before, the fundamentals will be familiar. Here, you can chose to use ""tap mode"" or ""button mode"", where you either touch the screen, or press the A/B/X/Y buttons, respectively. Since I'm a bumbling oaf, I figured button mode would be the easiest, but it turns out I like playing with tap mode better.

When you start the game, you choose which character you want to be, and the style of room. I chose Miku and the green room, but you can change that. The game uses StreetPass, so make sure you have an open StreetPass slot (Nintendo really needs to increase that). Since I've only had the game for less than a day, I haven't tagged anyone, nor have I used the AR cards. Dunno exactly how many AR cards there were, but seems like about 10.

When you play songs you earn points so you can buy new decorations for the room or outfits. There's some mini-games you can play. So far I've played Go, which you activate while in Hang-out mode. There's also a Tetris-style game on the main menu. You can collect different different stamps for accomplishments. You can take photos in game, which are saved to the SD or post them to Miiverse in the usual manner (there's a new Miiverse community for the game).

In the interests of brevity, I'm going to cut this short, but there are plenty of other things I haven't mentioned. If you like rhythm games, or just like Miku or the Nendoroid Vocaloids in general, this is a fun game so far with plenty to keep me occupied.",Project Mirai DX,1441756800,6,,
5.0,True,"11 14, 2006",A19EKT8H85AKO5,B000HTWX22,Bigstory,"I am a VERY old-school gamer and the last brand new home console system that I purchased was the Sega Dreamcast in 1999. I lost interest in the gaming scene after the Dreamcast died out. Reason being I didn't care much for 3-D polygonal games. I was bred on 2-D sprite based graphics. My very first system was the 2600 my parents got me in the early 80's. I've had almost every system ever since (between early 80's and 1999, I've had the Sega Master System, Turbo Graphix 16, Commodore 64, Super Nintendo, 3DO, Neo Geo, Sega Saturn, Sega Genesis, PS 1, etc..).

When the original PS 2 came out, I was skeptical. I knew that the eventual games being released at the time would not be of any interest to me. As it turned out, I was right. All the similar polygon-based games catering to the teenage male crowd was extremely boring to me.

However, around the middle part of the new millenium, I began noticing a nice amount of retro arcade collections for the PS 2. One example being the Capcom Classics collection. A large gathering of over 20 Arcade games for around 20 bucks. Remember, I came from a time when you paid 50 dollars for an inferior reproduction of 1 arcade game for a home console.

I also caught wind of a new redesinged PS 2 that wasn't all that larger than it's own controller. When I actually saw it, I was pretty impressed with the compact shape and looks of the new system. I still held out though. Not enough compilations to warrant the purchase of a new system.

But, several factors finally changed my mind. Additional compilations were being released, the one from Taito really caught my interest. There were even home console collections being released; I am talking about ones with a wide selection of games for a nominal price. Sony also dropped the price of the system. And finally, the release of this Silver colored system. I was sold.

I've had this system for about 4 days. First of all, looks really pretty. Love the silver color. The size is very compact. Very nice for my space challenged apartment. Of course, the system works with all my old PS 1 games along with the PS 1 memory cards. Load time for my PS 1 games is a lot faster. The controller feels nice and durable.

I've been enjoying games such as Ghost & Goblins, Super-Off Road, and Gladiator for the last several days. I am glad that I decided to purchase this new PS 2 system. Compact size, affordable price, and overall hugh selection of games. Whether you are into retro gaming or not, it is hard to go wrong with this system.

UPDATE- Just to clear up a potential confusion, despite what Amazon listed on their page for this PS 2 system, I did buy this from Amazon and the Sony Playstation 2 that arrived at my doorsteps is the North American NTSC format; NOT the European PAL version. So yes, this system plays all U.S. PS 2 games. Otherwise its been just over a week since I've had this system and I cannot wait to order Capcom Classics vol 2, Sega Genesis collection, and the Metal Slug Anthology. Keep the classics coming!

UPDATE(2)- I've had this system for about 2 years now and although the release of retro-collections are slowing down, I've had a blast with every collection that was released. SNK seems to be the last company to pump out a compilation here and there; I'll enjoy it while it last.

UPDATE(3)- 2 and a half years and I am still enjoying the system. Recently, I've been introducing my girlfriend to my large retro-gaming collection on the PS 2. She really enjoys the Namco stuff such as Dig Dug and Mappy. She also likes some of the Taito stuff. Good times!

UPDATE(4)- Lately I've been exploring the import shoot-em-ups market. Some of my favorites include Strikers 1945 1+2 and Gunbird 1+2. Still rolling with the PS2 after 3 years.

UPDATE(5)- 3 1/2 years with the PS2. Haven't had much of a chance to play recently. But when I do have a moment, I still play Mappy with my girlfriend to see who can beat the high score.",Party like it's 1999..,1163462400,86,,

  I recently bought and played Aliens Colonial Marines and really liked that game which made me decide to pick this game up and give it a try. This is definately a survival horror game especially playing the Colonial Marine part of the campaign. You will have a nervous and foreboding feeling the whole time you are playing as a Marine. The Aliens will be everywhere and coming at you from every angle at times causing you to be constantly looking from side to side and back to front. The only time I found myself completely relaxed is during one of the cut sceens.

  This game is broken down into three different campaigns. Marine , Alien , Predator. To me the marine playthrough is the best. You have none of the super powers like the Alien and Predator, leaving you with a more helpless feeling. As the Predator you have your super weapons and your cloak ability that renders you virtually invisable. As the Alien you can climb on wall , are extremly fast, and are virtually undetectable in dark spaces.

  All and all this is a great game even being several years old. this game is definately worth your time and money. Buy it used or buy it new it doesnt matter you won't regret it.

5.0,False,"07 22, 2010",A1GZQTVU5Y6TYE,B0014X7SQ6,TrippNessa,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to get this game or not because a lot of my friends had mentioned the leveling system being so bad it ruined the game for them. I ended up getting one of their copies of the game since they didn't like it so much and tried it out for myself. I have to say that I'm really glad I did!

First of all I want to address the leveling system since that seems to be everyone's make or break with this game. The way it basically works is during combat there is a roulette that spins constantly and depending on the results you get from each spin, different things happen. Getting a 777 is the only way for Zack to level, and getting 2 of the same number is the only way to level up your materia. However, what a lot of people don't realize is that there is actually an invisible experience counter recorded in the background, it just doesn't do the exact same thing you're probably used to. Instead it increases your chance of getting a 777 with the roulette spins. So because of this you actually will get 777's as often as you need to throughout the game. I've beaten it on both normal and hard and in both runs I NEVER had any issues with leveling up enough. And you can easily level your materia up by running the shinra training mission and just standing there, letting the roulette spin and level it up for you if you feel your magic is falling a little behind. So I really don't see why so many people hated the game for this system so much, it actually works pretty well and is easy to manipulate. I guess if you're really into the traditional leveling system and just can't stand the idea of this one then you might want to avoid this game... but I think it's a bit silly to miss out on this amazing storyline for something that actually does work if you gave it a chance.

So now that that's covered, let's address the actual combat. In my opinion it was more of a hack and slash than an RPG style of fighting. You could scroll through various attacks (physical, magical, healing, buffs, etc etc) and click them to use them. The combat was setup in a ""real time"" style, so you don't take turns like in most final fantasy games. You can block with the triangle button, which I did quite often. Basically don't expect FF7 fighting, expect more of a *chop chop chop chop SPELL chop chop HEAL spam buttons* thing. I really liked it myself.

""What kind of audience would want to buy this game?"" Well as anyone would expect, Crisis Core is going to have a lot more meaning to people who are fans of the Final Fantasy 7 storyline and have already completed the original game. However, because it's a prequel, anyone could actually play it and fully understand it, and enjoy it for what it is. So I'd say if you like a good storyline and a somewhat hack and slash style of fighting system then go for it!

""What kind of graphics should one expect?"" Some seriously amazing graphics for a PSP game is what you should expect! I was really surprised at the quality of this game and I think you will be too. Of course the graphics aren't as nice as say... a PS3 game, but you'll still be pretty impressed with what you get.

""Is the storyline interesting?"" Of course this will always come down to opinion, as with any storyline. The basics for this one, without giving any spoilers... you basically play as Zack Fair, a Soldier 1st class for the group Shinra. You work along side your fellow 1st Soldiers Genesis, Angeal and Sephiroth. Throughout the story you begin to learn more about your partner's pasts, your own and Shinra itself. You find out what Shinra is actually doing and what is destined for Zack. I personally really enjoyed the story presented from this game and I think if you like a darker plot you will too. Especially if you're a FF7 fan; there are so many moments you'll enjoy that other people won't really understand the meaning behind.

""What's the replay value of this game?"" I personally felt it had pretty good replay quality. I've beaten it twice and intend to play it again, and the 2nd time I played it I still got many hours of enjoyment and new content that I hadn't experienced the previous time. Though if you're the kind of person who plays with a walkthrough... I don't honestly know how the replay value will be. I don't use them myself because I want to discover it all on my own.

The second instalment offers nothing really new but managed to fix all the flaws in the first game, perfecting the art of this title.

Kingdom Hearts II continued with what's left behind in Chains of Memory on GBA. The plot thickens as you started off the game with an all new main character. It is also because of this that you can see other new Final Fantasy characters popping up in this new environment. This offers you a whole new surprise for the game.

The story is well written and it gives you twists and turns here and there to keep you going. Things that you thought were explained popped up in a way that you noticed that they were never actually resolved. This is the same for the story in Chains of Memory. Haven't played the first two games? No worries, Square-Enix had written the story in a way that provides tons of flash backs to bring you up to speed with the chronology of the Kingdom Hearts world.

In terms of gameplay, the battle system is more or less the same as the last one but with some new and minor updates. Now you have limit breaks and overdrive gauges. Veterans of Final Fantasy games will immediately notice that these are ideas from Final Fantasy VIII and X. Once unleashed with these commands when conditions are met you are rewarded with an extravaganza of battle combo. Also this time round, you have an option of not just going out hack and slash but deploy a more tactical approach in battles. The trigger command using the Triangle button allows you to employ battle related tactics response that could help you speed up the battle with context related attacks. This works for both random battles and boss fights. So you have an option of scarificing your X button all the way or use a more tactical approach to battles, which I think is pretty clever. The summon system is back and worked exactly the same way as last time round, though you will have new summons and some of them are actually hilarious than useful. The menu system is still not that friendly when it comes to battle despite you can have a quick menu to assist in battle. However, commands related to overdrive and limit breaks are still limited to menu driven and since battle is real time, it sometimes become pretty chaotic if you are not familiar with the menu.

The moogle synthesise shop is back too and so is the battle arena. The weapon system is a mixed of traditional Final Fantasy game and the Final Fantasy X ability system. So you have to think about how you want your characters to be. The abitlity system remains the same - which is similar to the ability system in Final Fantasy IX.

Another big improvement is the troublesome camera angle that plagued the first game. Remember how you swore in the battle with Ushula in the first game? The enemy is huge but the camera is stuck most of the time. The camera angle this time round are more flexible and Square-Enix have fixed most of the problems. The battle with Hydra proved that they had spent quite a bit of time dealing with the problem. However, when you have Beast in the party, he sometimes blocks your view and because of its size, the camera is sometime locked, which could still be frustrating.

The Gummi Ship is back and now Gummi Ship battles are more interesting cos you have different areas that actually show differences. Also, you win new prints by winning those battles, which gives you some incentive to do them.

In all, Kingdom Hearts II is a well balanced game that fixed a lot of previous flaws and improved upon the franchise's formula. It is a good game with a very gripping storyline. New areas that are added in this installment provides huge incentives for you to carry on with the game - remember to say hi to Johnny Depp when you see him in the game :)",A perfection of the original game,1158364800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I played them so much I got burned out on PGR4, so I traded it for a PS3 game.  I've spent the last few years playing the death out of Gran Turismo 5 and Forza Motorsport 4.  I found PGR4 on here brand new for only $4, and said it'd be fun to revisit an old favorite.

Wow!  This game is BEAUTIFUL!  The graphics are so vibrant and its an excellent artistic design all around.  The city atmosphere is a welcome change from the sterile tracks in these new race sims.  Sure, these environments don't have the same level of realism, but its more vivid and pretty.  This game is eye candy!

PGR4 has a pretty decent selection of Licensed cars from the big manufacturers.  These include Ford, Chevy, Ferrari, Lamborghini, BMW, Lotus, Aston-Martin, RUF (Porsche), Toyota, and the list goes on!  The driving physics are an arcade/sim blend.  Its more about having fun, so its not as brutal as Forza or GT.  Although AI can be brutal sometimes.  But you can adjust the difficulty.  The races and challenges are a ton of fun to me, especially now that I use a Fanatec CSR wheel, as opposed to a controller!

The Kudos scoring system, which gives bonus points for driving stunts, has been scaled back from earlier PGR games.  Motorcycles are included but I could care less.

I have played (replayed) about 1.5 hours of the story mode on each system, and its pretty much the same as DOA 5.  The differences are mostly in the looks of the game, and a couple new characters that I haven't had a chance to play with yet, if they added to the story its not until later in the game, but everything I have encountered states that they are not in the story, only in the ""arcade"" or online matches, which is okay.  As far as the gameplay goes, it is very well done;  the upgraded textures and models are fantastic, the movement is very smooth and responsive (which DOA has always been great with), and the ""signature physics of DOA"" have been upgraded a bit (change this in the options menu).  Overall, the changes are great, and visuals are very impressive on both systems, and the fighting is even more fluid than the original.

As far as differences between the two systems (here come the trolls), there isn't a lot of difference between PS4 and X1 visually, a few color balance differences, shading differences, and the textures are a bit different, but both systems look great and you probably wouldn't notice if you weren't playing them back to back or side to side.  I am sure people will argue about this online (brand loyalists, to put it nicely), but I am here to tell you the difference is subjective, and neither one really looks better than the other in this game.  Where there WAS a VERY SLIGHT difference in gameplay itself, was in the responsiveness.  The PS4 was just a little more responsive than the X1, and a little more fluid, but again, probably not something you would notice if you were not playing back to back.  The difference between the PS3 and PS4 is much greater, and if you enjoy this game on PS3, you will enjoy it even more on the PS4.  I cannot compare the XBox 360 to the X1, as I have not played it on 360, but I am sure the differences are comparable to the PS versions.  If you own either the PS4, or XB1, and you enjoy DOA, I highly recommend this upgraded version (if you own both, get whichever is your favorite, you won't be missing out with one system over the other this time); If you enjoy fighting games, and haven't tried DOA yet, I can almost assure you that you will love it as it is a very responsive, fluid, and fast paced fighter that really can't be beat.

All in all, its D.O.A., with the best graphical engine in the series to date, there isn't much else to say about it (and that isn't a bad thing).","DOA 5, with better responsiveness and graphics (and upgraded ""DOA physics"")",1424304000,19,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

All I can say is, Wow... With nearly six-decades on the planet, younger/faster reflexes will often beat me, but the G25 is a great equalizer for those of us who'd really like to hang around the track in real-time again, but don't have enough hours left in the business week to keep a car competitive, let alone haul it back and forth... Anyone who has hung around real race-teams even at the local/amateur level will love the realism of the G25, and the easy trip to the exotic tracks of the world -- all while sitting behind first class equipment and not needing a second mortgage to do it.

Installation was quick on my workhorse XP machine -- although there is a basket of wires to get sorted through, but essentially a no-brainer...

Haven't begun to use all the features yet, but my track times dived almost immediately - largely due to the accuracy, precision and correctness of the movement - subtle moves translate into subtle moves, not jerks and sporadic twitches that separate this machine from lesser mechanisms... The smell of leather after a sweaty hour of racing Steve Kinser or Tony Stewart adds measurably to the realism and enjoyment, and the force-feedback is almost transparent... it does the usual wheel twitch when something ""hits"" the front wheels, but also handles the more subtle feel of the front-tires starting to let go at the beginning of understeer/push...  nice, really nice... the grin factor is huge.",The G25 is top-drawer all the way,1167091200,32,,

I'll say this now: I'm not a fan of the Resident Evil games. I'm no pansy that hates being scared but it's kind of hard to get scared when you're packing a pump shotgun.(Geez you came out of nowhere! Now die Punk <Fire shotgun at their face>). Not totally exciting. But for some reason I just had to play Resident Evil 4. Could be a bit of a drought in games lately(I've beaten MGS3, Metroid Prime 2 and San Andreas, don't have Xbox to play Halo 2). And after picking it up, it's a stellar entry into a series I kind of despise.

Story: Takes place in 2004, 6 years after Raccoon City was nuked to stop the T-Virus from spreading. Once a rookie cop during that time, Leon Kennedy is now an agent who receives an assignment: rescue the President's daugther, Ashley. While there, he finds a man in a cabin who doesn't take too kindly to strangers and attacks Leon. Leon is then attacked by a huge horde of them but something's wrong: they're faster, even a bit smarter, using traps and ambushing, even ladders into windows. These aren't the same zombies as before.

Graphics: If not the best then one of the best graphics on any home console. The locations and villages have a strong atmosphere and totally immerses you into it with real-looking environments. And wait till the boss battles, nothing as massive as Quadraxis from Metroid Prime 2(thank god) but they're some of the most cinematic bosses ever.

Sound/Music: A survival/horror games lives or dies(no pun intended) by it's music. If it can immerse you and make you edgy with creeking floorboards, footsteps, distant cries then it'll get you perfectly in tune with the environments. While there's some cases of bad voice acting, it's miles above what the series used to have(no overracted ""Ada!"" here).

Gameplay: If you're a RE fan or not, you'll probably agree with me on this: the control scheme felt busted. It was just awkward. People have compared it to driving a tank. And since the old games used a static camera(never really moved), due to the camera switching to the next scene, your character would now have slightly different controls. Up was always used to move your character forward so if the camera now has you in the background coming to the foreground, your first instinct to go down towards the camera makes you go back to the previous screen but going up was the correct way.

It's finally changed in Resident Evil 4. The camera takes a Splinter Cell-esque approach with the camera just behind Leon's right shoulder. It's not true 3rd person perspective a la Ratchet and Clank or Zelda but it's enough.

Also changed is the dynamics in battles, which are plentiful, sometimes too much so. It's not uncommon to have 10-15 of these...""things"" after you. You can shoot them in the leg to slow them down or drop them to their knees, shoot their arms to drop the weapons, shoot the dynamite they throw so it explodes right in their face or blow their head off with a well-aimed bullet(not always, sometimes they just act as if the bullet grazed their face, holding it in pain). Word of advice: when it's nighttime, DO NOT blow their heads off. Drawers and tables can be moved in front of doors to barricade yourself in for awhile.

Like Shenmue, the A button is context-sensitive which means in certain areas, you can do a specific action. If an enemy has a ladder against a window, you can push it off. If they get too close, you can roundhouse kick them away. You can crouch from too close explosions etc. Aiming is a bit slow but it's a hell of a lot better than previous entries where you couldn't tell if you were directly aiming at them or not until you fired.

As for downsides? The action gets to be too intense at times with a large number coming at you from all sides and since the camera focused directly in front of Leon, you can't see if anyone is running at the sides or behind. There's no strafing(literally walking sideways, controlling Leon is either back, forward or turning) and no dodging like in Nemesis.

You have to switch to your ammo in the menu also. Can't just simply click a button and switch from your grenade to a gun. Your inventory is changed but it's slightly bothersome since your arsenal, first aid sprays and ammo take up space on a grid. Your shotgun takes up a good 3-4 spaces which would be perfect for ammo or herbs(your potions essentially). You can ""level up"" your guns and your attache case(no magically connected item boxes here) so you can carry more stuff. However, none of these cause you to just quit the game entirely, they're just things that'll irk you.

Dust off your Gamecube and pop this in. This is probably the most funnest action games in years and you'll oddly find yourself wanting to blow off some more heads and kill these spanish speaking enemies when you're not playing. Did I mention the controls are changed?",2005 starts with a bang,1105488000,5,,

They are usually rush jobs meant to cash in on a new release (see: Matrix for a recent example) and, in essence, trick the buyer.  That is most assuredly not the case with Riddick.  This is one of the 10 best XBox games ever, and many are saying that it's oodles better than the actual film!
The strength of Chronicles is its immersive, story-driven environment.  I was a bit skeptical about the first person view (First person shooters on consoles tend to be really hard to control due to the absence of a mouse and keyboard combo), but I was surprised by how well it worked here.  In many ways, this game is part Role Playing, part stealth, part shooter and part Adventure.  The environments you explore are really, really well done (atmospheric is the word), and the play of light and shadow is the best this side of Splinter Cell.
GRAPHICS: 9/10.  Very, very good.  In my mind, only Morrowind and Splinter Cell surpass this game for overall graphical brilliance.  There are some anti-aliasing problems during some of the cinematics, but gameplay is smooth.
CONTROL: 9/10.  There are some annoyances, such as inadvertantly pressing the crouch or shine-vision buttons while fighting, but they are mostly minor.  The control scheme is unobtrusive and once you get the feel of the fighting controls, you'll have a blast.
SOUND: 8/10.  I wasn't bowled over by either the music or the sound effects, but everything is in keeping with the dingy, grimy world you are in.  The voice-overs and acting are really well done, though.
GAMEPLAY: 9/10.  Awesome.  Everyone says it's too short, but I think that's because the game is so good that you want it to last longer!  The production values are top-notch (you feel like you are watching the real Vin Diesel), and the story is good.  It's not exactly Shakespeare, but it's a suspenseful journey through a very well rendered environment.  There are plot twists and some really scary or tense moments, the level design is for the most part excellent, and the missions themselves are varied and nonrepetitive.  I would have liked a bigger world (GTA 3 and Morrowind have spoiled me) with more side-quests, as well as more weapons, but hey.

If you appreciate good science fiction and dig very cool, very strange graphics then you will not be disappointed.
Lots of awesome unlockables round out a very polished production.  The cut scenes tell a well-crafted tale and the game world is extremely detailed in it's execution.

There you go, no need to read further. You're wasting valuable playing time.

For those with a bit more of an attention span: Game of the Year --- because ---

While it seems at first glance that Fallout 3 might just be Oblivion reskinned, spending a little time with this game will dispell that notion completely. Yes, it's made by Bethesda and if you've played their earlier RPGs Morrowind and Oblivion you will see a lot of similarities and will definitely feel right at home with this game. But the similarities quickly fade into mere recognizable structural convention as the player begins to see that there is a rather stout and unexpected FPS mixed with their RPG.

Okay RPG players it's not going to be all mindless or super difficult finger twitching gun battles --- you are thinkers --- well the VATS system is only one button away and you can take a half an hour to pick a limb, body, or head shot if that's how you wish to play. All the strategy of leveling up, what powers to get, weapons to get, and what armor etc. are still there --- there's even a very lite version of co-op play if you find the right characters.

And to the skeptical FPS players --- I've played 'em all --- all the Halo games, Far Cry, Bioshock etc. etc. etc. --- whatever --- and this is as smooth and solid as any of those games as a shooter. I repeat, smooth and solid. But when you want a little extra sauce on your kills, once again, the VATS system is the answer for you as well. Very satisfying slow motion ultra-gory head explosions and full utilization of the Havoc psychics engine are just a button push away. Really that's nothing but pure fun.

This is an extremely detailed and fascinating world that is brought to life with great care, ambition, and talent. Also, as simple and predictible as the story might be, I found myself actually following it and often being amused by it instead of completely ignoring it on my way to the next action sequence. I swear, I have no idea what's going on in Halo for example --- nor do I care.

And lastly, for the Fallout 1 and 2 players --- you probably won't think anything will be as good as those games. But really this game has captured a lot of the flavor those games --- while attaining a very next generation playability --- besides we need to move into this century now. Here's a tissue.

Bethesda, Nice effort on this outstanding game and also on the excellent collectors edition --- cool bobble, art book, video, and lunch box. My favorite CE so far.",Oblivion Reskinned or Game of the Year,1228176000,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The animation is great, but the creators also have a great cinematic sense. A lot of games have really beautiful cut scenes and then it cuts to the game and those beautiful cut scenes are replaced with something lesser... not here. NOT THIS GAME. The cut scenes blend beautifully... the cut scenes are just as pristine and drawn as the images when you're in control.

This is one of... if not the, most engrossing gave I've ever played. It gets you involved. You get drawn into the character and the mystery of who he is and what happened to him. You participate in his present day situation where he is escaping from a hospital and searching for his identity and you also go back to his early military days when he trains with weapons and participates in action as a sniper as a normal military person.

You can heal yourself, make yourself invisible for a certain period of time, eradiate bursts of dangerous and deadly energy, split your body in two as you stay safe somewhere and your apparition goes forward to do tasks... and that's just the beginning.

This game is fantastic. I'm so glad I bought it and I certainly recommend it for anyone who hasn't played it.

You'll see a lot of negative reviews on here complaining (many on the day of release) that the game is hard. I don't know why it needs to be said, but just in case, yes the game is very hard. That's part of the point. This isn't for people who want an easy game. This isn't a game you can just relax and play. There's a lot of people out there who want that, and that's who this is for. If you're upset that the game is difficult, you bought the wrong game.

If you don't want a difficult game, play something else. Whatever you do though, don't buy this and then complain about how it's too challenging. You might as well complain about how horror movies are too scary, roller coasters are too fast, and water is too wet. The difficulty is a selling point, not a hidden surprise.

You'll see other people complaining about a lack of forced narrative, or how the game doesn't go through explaining what to do or where to go. That's part of the appeal. You wander around and you get lost. You find hidden secrets and shortcuts, and you explore labyrinthine areas full of dangerous creatures. The mystery and surprise is what makes it great. If you want to see this same formula with a forgettable non-plot, play Lords of the Fallen.

For fans of the Souls series, this is exactly what you've been waiting for. It's endlessly challenging, graphically gorgeous, and the atmosphere and world is leaps and bounds more realized and compelling than anything else out there. You'll get frustrated, you'll get angry, but if you dig in deep enough you'll discover an unparalleled, immersive experience.

Anyway, this game is great fun and well worth the money.  Like I said in my other review, it's essentially 3 games in one.  I did end up beating the game on the hardest difficulty, and it was challenging.  However, you learn so much on the previous playthroughs that you should be skilled enough to get through without as much trouble.  As for co-op....right now I'm a level 23 Medic, which I'm trying to max out.  Haven't played too much competitive, but Skirmish is BY FAR my favorite mode.  It's very similar to the Co-op play style, but you are going against real people and get team points by completing objectives.

As far as the CE version, I like everything that came in the CE so far.  In fact I plan on making an entire shelf, once I finish my basement, to display my collectables (ala 40 Year Old virgin) and this one will be included.  I'm sure the wife will be impressed....LOL!  I still haven't watched the Bluray that was included since I've been too busy playing the crap outta this game.

5.0,True,"12 7, 2012",A3OUX19WZP2WOZ,B009759F5A,RyanIPZ,"The Xbox with Kinect is a great product. I bought this as an upgrade for my old Xbox 360. Here are the main things that I like about this bundle:

Kinect - The kinect does an amazing job recognizing your body and its movements. The games that I've played on it include Dance Central 2 & 3, Kinect sports, Fruit Ninja Kinect, and Kinect Adventures. Every game is a lot of fun by yourself or with friends. The Kinect also adds a lot of convenience with its voice commands. I can control almost anything just by talking to it. It also remembers what you look like and will automatically sign you in when it ""sees"" you. Also, as far as long term use goes, Microsoft made this product very well. It will adjust itself to get the best camera angle for the space that you are in. Also, the kinect provides a great source of exercise. Playing any of the Kinect games will get your blood flowing and sweat dripping. Its amazing how sore it will make you the next day. It really is a ton of exercise. Lastly, there are no mats, remotes, or other items required.

Xbox Slim - The new design is fantastic. It is quite a bit smaller than its predecessor. The AC power adapter is also smaller, which is really nice. The hard drive is now inserted internally and can be inserted and removed with ease. This gets rid of the awkward bump on the top of the Xbox. Another improvement that really impressed me is the airflow through the console. Its hot air is pushed out of the machine much more effectively than in the previous model. This, in theory, should reduce the amount of RROD that occurs. One aspect of the new console that I wasn't  all too thrilled about are the ""buttons"" to turn on the console and to open the disk tray. They are now touch activated which some people may like but I personally do not.

I also want to share a couple things that I was unaware of when I purchased the console (which I'm sure are easy to find if you're looking but just incase anyone made assumptions like myself). The console no longer comes with HD AV cables. It is now just standard AV cables and some models include an HDMI chord. I personally preferred the picture quality with the HD AV cable over the HDMI. This (after doing some research) turns out to be an issue that people with Samsung TVs have when using HDMI cables. Also, all consoles now come in the matte finish. All of the arcade consoles used to be matte and the others were glossy, but Microsoft finally came to their senses and discontinued the glossy consoles. The Kinect however is still glossy, which perhaps is a good thing since most TVs have a glossy finish.",Amazing,1354838400,10,,

+A Very Powerful Handheld Device
+Plays music, movies, and allows you to look at photos
+Browsing online is fun
+A lot of accessories available
+Now has a good library of games
+Easy interface and control
+Very detailed screen and large

Cons:

-Online browsing isn't that much fun
-Can't organize a music library and UMDs aren't all that fun to watch, even on road trips
-The battery life isn't long lasting
-The screen is easily damaged

When the original PSP launched back in 2005, it eventually became subjected to heavy criticism.  Not necessarily the console itself, but mostly that much of what it did, people didn't see the use for in a handheld system, and the fact that its library of games wasn't incredible.  Nevertheless, the PSP has still shown itself to be a powerhouse of a console.

First and foremost, this review is not here to talk about the Nintendo DS.  If you would like a review or comparison to the Nintendo DS, I highly suggest you look for reviews under the Nintendo DS or use the forums.  Most people on the amazon community will be very helpful in helping you decide on which handheld is the best for you.

The new PSP is much better than the original.  It's slimmer, lighter, and a slightly bigger screen that actually makes some of the picture look a bit more crisp.  Some games also run a little faster, and that more than helps the PSP out.

What the PSP has best been known for (and criticized the most for) is being a handheld entertainment center.  It can do more than just play games.  It can play music, go online, play movies, and you can look at photos.  This is all built into the system and doesn't require you to purchase any extra peripherals to use.  While these are all good and well, they come with slight hitches.  You can't organize a playlist when it comes to the music, and while going online is great, it's pretty sluggish when you have to input addresses and such via a keypad function similar to that of a cell phone.  Movies are great too, but a UMD on the PSP's small screen isn't enough to replace a DVD or Blu-Ray disc.

Luckily, however, the PSP isn't a home entertainment center and is a gaming console.  In that respect it gets the job done.  The Slim PSP works because the interface is very user friendly.  You can select several things from the main menu to do.  Whether it be to play music, browse photos or just start a game.  When playing a game you can return to the home menu at any time.  The system even sleeps if you suddenly have to put it down.  The UMDs are also a great gaming format.  There's plenty of space, which makes some games live up to their potential in length, and also pushes how powerful the PSP is.  In terms of graphics, it's like walking around with a Playstation 2 in your pocket.

The PSP does suffer from a couple of setbacks.  The battery is still pretty short in length.  It lasts much longer in the slim PSP than the original, but it still isn't that long lasting.  At least you can always check how much battery is left, and when it gets low it'll let you know.  Even better for the PSP is that even if the battery dies in the middle of a game, you can just charge it and resume right from where you left off since the console will merely go to sleep.

The other setback with the PSP is that the screen can be damaged pretty easily.  In order to protect it you'll need to spend more money on accessories such as a case to protect it.  It's also not the most durable system you can buy.  You have to be a bit more delicate with it because it's a bit more fragile than most other consoles out there.  Luckily, most of you probably won't drop it purposefully, but in case a parent is looking at giving it to a child, you may want to watch to make sure they don't drop it on a concrete or hard surface.

For a couple of years, the PSP has suffered the most from having a fairly tight library.  Most of its more notable games were either ported from the Playstation 2 or ported TO the Playstation 2.  With the PS2 no longer being the focal point, it has certainly allowed the PSP to grow much more.  We're now seeing much better games and much more expanded games.  The library is still fairly short on fantastic games, but at least now it's growing as a gaming system.  If you're interested in a PSP, now is not a bad time to grab one as there are better games being released and it's been built to last.

The PSP is a good handheld device.  With a volley of games to choose from all across the spectrum, the PSP really does serve as a good gaming choice for everyone.",A Great System,1212537600,31,,

Though its set further in the future, ""Dawn of Sorrow"" has an eerie feeling of familiarity if you've played the classic ""Symphony of the Night"" (SotN):  vague castle similarities and enemy similarities (some characters/enemies even use the same sprites) pop up here and there to give players of the older Castlevania a nostalgic feeling of recognition but many things are new or changed up a bit enough to keep it fresh and interesting.

Other people have covered it more thoroughly, but these are my likes and dislikes:

The graphics are beautiful, are colorful and crisp on the small DS screens. The controls are simple to understand and easy to use. And the gameplay, particularly with the ""abilities-obtained-through-the-collection-of-souls"" is a lot of fun and makes for a variety of playing styles (i.e. snipe from afar or get up close and whack 'em). It's difficult to find a description of the soul system that doesn't sound daunting. In short, it's as if you took all the secondary weapons (i.e. dagger, axe, diamond, holy water), familiars, shapeshifting abilities, and magic spells from SotN and put them into a single ability system, the soul system.

This game is great for players who like to discover every single ability and hidden nook and cranny (like me), though I think for people who simply want to get through it and beat the game it could be a bit less enjoyable since it takes a LOT of time and repetition to get some of the more useful souls or to upgrade souls by collecting multiples of the same kind. I have spent hours simply trying to collect all 9 souls of specific kinds. On the one hand, I probably could of beaten the game by now but on the other, I sure have some powerful (and fun) abilities - and having an 'all powerful' character is half the fun, right? :D  So my only dislike at the moment would be that once I finish it I'm not going to feel like replaying such an enormous game again anytime soon.",If you loved Symphony of the Night...,1170115200,,,

5.0,False,"01 31, 2003",AKFE1P1ZDBPXU,B00002STJI,Amazon Customer,"Mega Man X4 (1997). The fourth episode in the seven part spin-off series, and first one to be released on Playstation.
Not many decade-long-running series of games stay true to their roots, but for the Mega Man series, keeping the same old-school, 2-D platform, nostalgic gameplay is a given. Critics hate the never-changing evolution of Mega Man, but real fans (like me) love it and take it in any form it comes. Here we have X4, one of the best and my second favorite X game (X3 is my favorite). This was my first X game I've ever owned and so it holds a special place to me. Now I will go over the pros and cons to X4 in terms of gameplay, graphics, sound, etc.:
PROS:
-First of all, THE ANIME CUTSCENES ARE PHENOMENAL. They not only have quality Japanese animation, but they also enhance the storytelling of the game. Sadly, this is the only X game you will ever see anime cutscenes in (unless you track down an EXTREMELY RARE copy of X3 for the PS or Saturn).
-Secondly, the story itself. X4's storyline is very well put together. It starts out with Magma Dragoon destroying sky lab and bringing it down on a city full of people, killing them. X and Zero, of course, demand to know why a reploid of the repliforce caused this terrible catastrophe. However, Colonel (2nd leader of the repliforce) refuses to surrender to X, and so the entire repliforce wages war against the Maverick Hunters. This was all really caused by Sigma, who was playing both sides to get them to fight each other. I like the addition of the sub-characters (Double and Iris), and how they play key roles in each of the main characters' storylines. I won't reveal any more of the story, so as not to spoil the game endings.
-The new feature of playing as either X or Zero. SIMPLY AWESOME. You could do that in the previous game, but here is where you can choose who to play through the entire game. X is better for shooting long range, whereas Zero is more of a melee fighter.
-Gameplay-wise, the action in the series couldn't get any better. There are certainly plenty of enemies and things to shoot, no matter where you go. Most aren't too hard, but they do provide enough challenge so as to keep you busy.
-The sound effects are a major improvement over what the Super Nintendo could do. Likewise, THE MUSIC HERE IS PERFECT FOR AN X GAME. It's sort of a japanese 80's style techno-hardrock soundtrack. I love it. Most every track is memorable and goes well with each stage and the pace of the action.
-I like how many of the stages have new elements thrown in that were not used before. For instance, in Cyber Peacock's stage, you must race to the end, and if you make it fast enough, you get a bonus. Slash Beast's stage is on a moving train. Plus, I thought it was clever to reward the players in Magma Dragoon's stage in letting them use the robot-ride-armor to fight the boss if they make it through the stage unscathed.
CONS:
-The only thing wrong with the anime cutscenes is the voice acting. Like in Mega Man 8, and in a lot of anime, THE VOICE ACTING IS TERRIBLE. It comes off as annoying, especially X's voice. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO MAKE HIM SOUND LIKE AN 8 YEAR OLD GIRL?? Still, having anime cutscenes with bad voice acting is better than having no anime at all.
-While the action itself is outstanding, I thought that X4's stages, in comparison to other games, are WAY TOO SHORT, EASY, AND LINEAR. There's only one path, and the continue points make all the stages shorter. Jet Stingray's stage can be beaten in less than two minutes, which to me seems like the programmers are just being lazy. Plus, there are not very many secrets, and all of them are rather easy to find. Not bad, but a letdown from X3's more complex level structures and secret collecting.
-I think that there should have been a way to switch back and forth between characters at the stage select screen. Fortunately, this problem is remedied in X5 and X6. It's not really that big of a deal, though.
Overall, even though there are minor setbacks which keep it from being perfect, X4 is still by far one of the best in the series. It's very easy to find and a great way for newbees to get into the X series. The next two games turned out to be a mixed bag of sorts (X5 was made for beginners, and X6 for hardcore fans. Go figure). So what are you waiting for? Get equipped with bubble lead and go buy this game right now!",A good place to start if you're first getting into Megaman X,1043971200,4,,

I purchased this from Gamestop on release date and will have Amazon refund.

I hear a lot of bad things about this game, but I don't really understand why as of now? I loved Oblivion and Skyrim and logged in 300+ hrs between the 2 games. I love ESO so far. It is different from both of them, but not so much different than oblivion vs skyrim??

Differences

It's almost chaotic how many other players are running around when you're playing the game. This was a big difference from previous games for sure. This was also an introduction to MMORPG for me. With the exception of Destiny.
Needing online to play and having to connect to server before playing. I was loading for 10 minutes at one point before I could play, but I'm assuming this will only get better as time goes on.
Upgrading system is different (but it was between oblivion and skyrim too)
Carrying capacity isn't based on weight.
No arrows for archery, just point and shoot over and over again. You can full draw for a harder shot.
Combat is better, I think.. There is a lot of upgrades I'm reading about that I haven't taken advantage of yet.
World is much different. It's still open world feel, but there are other areas I'm assuming I won't be able to travel to yet.
It seems blacksmithing and alchemy might be a bit harder?
An almost overwhelming amount of side quests. There are so many little misc missions so far.

I haven't been able to do a lot of things in this game yet do to my low level, but I will revise my review as time goes on. So far I have nothing but positive feedback about the game.

If you were expecting Skyrim all over again, you won't get it. I wouldn't say this is a better game, I wouldn't say it's worse.. It's different for sure! But in my opinion it's a fun experience either way.

06/19/2015 Update: Still loving the game 10 days later. Problems with signing in and getting kicked have completely stopped. I have a level 10 high elf and level 10 orc. I haven't had any problems at all, since 06/14/2015.

All the missions work great, haven't dove into PvP much, but seems interesting.

If your scared to buy this game because of server problems, getting kicked, not getting in, etc.. Then there is no need to worry. I've been playing fairly often and haven't had a single problem.

  Improvements

Nintendo did a amazing job on this. First of all,the graphics are beautiful. Very well detailed. All the characters look very real. Best graphics for super smash bros. Plus,New characters like chazarid,grininja,dark pit,lucina,and more. All new maps have been added like lumious city and resident bomb.(well,I think it was added to this one). Smash run has been added. You have to collect as many stat bousts as possible and then do something at the end like 300% smash or a race. All star mode was made so you can battle all characters in order. Like which ones came first. Like brawl,you can fight online,too. You can play up to 8 players at once!!!!

  Hidden characters

If you play enough,you can unlock hidden characters. They are falco,jigglypuf,dark pit,R.O.B,Luciana,wario,ness,rosalima and luma,duck hunt,mr game and watch,and bowser jr. They are add ons to the game. They also help you beat the game.

  Tips

The game can be hard,so here are some useful tips. If you want characters that are fast,then I recommend fox. He is very fast and is also very good in battle. If you want a strong player,then use samas. She is amazing in battle. Her charge up attack is very powerful. Stay away from the villager. He is op.(not kidding). Unless you want to annoy someone,then don't use kirby!!!! All he does is swallow you and takes your power!!!! Really annoying.

  All the characters

Here are all the characters. Fox and falco(from star fox). Pikachu,mewtwo,chazarid,jigglypuf,grininja,and lucario(from pokemon). Link,toon link,Zelda,and gandrof(from the legends of Zelda). Mario,Luigi,bowser,and peach(from super Mario bros). Kirby,meta knight,and king dedaede(from kirby). Little mac(from punch out!). Sonic(from sonic the hedgehog). Pit,dark pit,and pauathina(from kid icaurs). Villager(from animal crossing). Ness(from mother and earth bound). Yoshi(from yoshi). Samas and zero suit samas(from metorid). Donkey Kong and deyede kong(from donkey Kong). Duck hunt(from duck hunt). Mr game and watch(from game and watch). Losaumia and Luna,and boswer Jr(Mario galaxy). Mega man(from mega man). Dr Mario(from Dr Mario). Captain falcon(from f-zero). Marty,lucania,and ike(from fire enamble). Wii fit trainer(from some wii game). And mii fighters(from mii channel).(because that mii character you made can become a mii fighter).

  Download character

By using the Nintendo eshop,you can download mewtwo. I think it's awesome since mewtwo is a good pokemon. You should download him. I mean,come on,he's epic.

Anyways,this game is great and I highly recommend this game. So much fun!!!! Super smash bros is one of Nintendo's greatest hits!!!! Get it now!!!!

It is smooth, it lets you feel relaxed while also feeling fast pased, don't ask me how it just dose.

A level of deatail not often seen in games, everything is realintic except the occasonal where somthing odd happens like once I died and then fell through the ground Mario style.

This time I wanted a lot more buttons, and this mouse seemed to fit the bill. It has 4 buttons on top of the standard right and left buttons on the mouse. It has a scrollwheel that can also tilt to the left and the right. The scrollwheel is pretty cool in the sense that you can kinda ""unlock"" it and it can scroll up/down pretty fast. I usually keep it locked so it behaves like a regular scrollwheel. There's also a DPI button, but I never use this.
It also has a modifying button thing that can be thought of as an fn button for the mouse buttons, so this effectively doubles the amount of functions you have on the palm of your hands. For gaming, this is a pretty useful feature, I can pretty much play MMOs without relying on a keyboard for a good 90% of the time.
For web browsing and general computer usage, this has made my life so much more comfortable that it's almost a crime.
The weight add-ons that you attach on the bottom of the mouse is neat. If you like a heavier mouse, you can have a heavier mouse, if you prefer a lighter one, you can do that too. I personally like it with all the weights attached.
Aesthetically, I like it. You can switch the LED to whatever you want. You can turn it off if you want. And there are little bars on the side that tell you which mouse profile you're on (which you can also change on the fly, giving you even more functions.)

Not much else to say. Mouse is accurate, the software is all right. I think it's slightly confusing at first, or perhaps kind of overwhelming at first, but it's really easy to use and configure.

The game is simple enough to be enjoyable amateurs, but complex enough to keep you interested and doesn't feel terribly repetitive (although some of the levels are clearly copied and re-skinned).

In this game, you'll drive on race tracks from other worlds based on the hit TV series.  They're very detailed, though challenging at some points like certain switches that trigger events, but mostly shortcuts.  And you get to race as Ben, Kevin, Vilgax, or one of Ben's alien hero forms in a custom kart they drive in, plus they have special powers that are offensive or defensive depending on your aerial stunts or drift sliding.  (Personally, I think Ben may be the better choice on account of he has all the alien forms into one racing package.)  There are also special power-ups called Omni-Nodes that can cause great pain and suffering to the other racers if not yourself.

Overall, it's a pretty great game if you're a fan of Ben 10 or you just want to feel the adrenaline rush of a racing game.  And you can't beat the authenticity of the game; case in point, the art style, the music and sound effects, not to mention the authentic voice-overs.  It's something worth buying, all right.

PROS:
- REALLY durable. This is probably the most durable feeling headset I have ever owned.
- The physical features are amazing! The volume +/- switch is really convenient and the mic mute button has a nice feature -- the LEDs glow red instead of blue if your mic is muted!
- The earmuffs are made of memory foam and a fuzzy cloth material. They don't stick to your ears like pleather, and they are super comfortable.
- Easy installation. Just plug and go! I recommend Googling ""Corsair Vengeance 1500 Drivers"" and downloading the latest drivers, then restarting your PC before full use of the headset.
- The equalizer program that comes with the drivers is amazing and easy to use. It makes the sound quality even better than before!
- It's super light weight for its size!

CONS:
- The only con I have is that this headset is HUGE. This isn't a big deal, as it's still comfortable, but if you have limited space around your desk, this headset is a bit of a problem.

PRO/CON?:
- One thing that I can't decide whether it's a pro or con is the cord. It's really long (10ft or so?), which can be a great feature or a horrible one. It mainly depends on your environment. Luckily, the cord has a little velcro strap for wrapping the cord up, so you can somewhat adjust the length.

SUMMARY:
Overall, I am in love with this headset. It's kind of big and makes me look like a DJ when I'm in webcam chats with friends, but other than that, I have yet to find a real problem with it. Everything looks, sounds, and works great! I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a ""hardcore gamer headset.""

ALSO! This headset DOES have its own sound card. Therefore, it will help your FPS a slight bit. (No more than 5-10 FPS, probably, depending on the PC.)",Amazing gaming headset!,1327104000,,{'Style:': ' 1500'},
5.0,False,"04 4, 2002",A6FISTEU3PLPM,B00005NSUQ,-BigDaddy-,"I pre-ordered this game a while ago. I was very anxious to see if they could improve on an already cool game. I was not disappointed! Some of the pro's were, improved graphics( They Rock!), higher resolution as well, instead of waiting for seven days to get the next weeks critters you get them incrementally. If, say, you get 24 archers a week and you've already cleared out what you had, the next day there will be a few more, and the next a few more, etc... This is a good feature so that you always have at least a few troops available to defend against an annoying hero with a tiny army who just happens to show up right after you left with all your garrison with you. Another neat feature is the roaming monsters. If you are close to a monster(s) who is,for example, guarding a gold mine, the monster may well charge after you. This adds excitement and unpredictability to the game. Another nice feature is that the ""life"" towns hero's, with the ressurection magic can automaticly raise dead after a battle the same as Necromancers, but unlike the necromancer who raises enemy dead, the priest raises their own dead. Speaking of the Necromancers, they start by raising skeletons, then it goes to ghosts, then vampires! Maybe more but I'm still learning this version.
Anyway, there are a few downsides. First They don't have a random map maker like they had in Heroes III. They have a campaign editor that works like the editor in Starcraft, which is painfully slow and cumbersome. I hope if they do any upgrades that they will include a map generator. This gives the game inexhaustive replayability. Secondly, this may just be me, but I wish that there was some way to limit the amount of towns. In Civ III you could choose to raze an unwanted town or keep it. This may be too problematic, but I hate running too many towns. In an eight player game there may be a dozen or more towns!
Well, I think this game is really good. If you liked Heroes III then you will really dig this one. Without the random map maker I rate this a 4.5 stars. Since I couldn't choose that, I put 5 stars",Fresh look for an old kick'in classic,1017878400,23,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

It was unlike anything I've seen before, how crisp, clear, and clean they looked and made a successful effort to drag you into the world of halo. That was just the beginning and there was still more that meets the eye.

I noticed that sending bullets into aliens never seemed to get old. How where you place the shot would determine how fast the alien would go down. Headshot by far the most effective while shooting them in the foot proved least effective.

The story itself is fantastically written. Even the events that led to halo (told in ""The Fall Of Reach"") proved to be a well thought out presentation both by the author and the designers.

""Whoa!"" That was literally the first thought I had when I unpacked this keyboard. I've honestly never used a keyboard this cool and specialized before but I was immediately excited to try this out!

It's full-sized so it's a bit big (read: make sure you have ample desk space!), but it's completely plug-and-play and works on both Macs and PCs. The backlighting is totally trippy and definitely got the attention of my coworkers. Plus it's water resistant! Anyone who knows me can attest to the fact that I can easily be categorized as a ""klutz"" so this was a really pleasant feature to learn about.

I can't attest to it's gaming capabilities as I am a console gamer, but what matters most to me is having a keyboard that I can usual for long stretches of time while I work (lot's of typing in my work). This is easily the most ergonomically comfortable keyboard I've ever used. It is mechanical but the tactile feel/sound of the keys is terrific!

5.0,False,"06 17, 2008",A189VNOYNTHFTR,B0014WJ78E,Manuel Guzman,"First of all, this is my second PS3 console.  I already own the original Sony 60GB PS3 version and for a long time, I have wanted a second one to have in my bedroom as a Blu-ray player and to play certain games I can't play with my newborn around the house (i.e. Metal Gear Solid 4).

I love this console so much.  As a media center, it does almost everything.  It is the only gaming console to be fully Divx certified.  And obviously, it plays back Blu-ray movies.  In fact, it is probably still the best Blu-ray player you can purchase today.  The gaming library has improved quite a bit since the original launch of the console.

I've been looking forward to Metal Gear Solid 4 for quite a long time.  It was well worth the wait.  I didn't think I would be a fan of the Dual Shock 3 controller as I usually could care less for rumble but it actually works well with Metal Gear Solid 4 and it weighs more than the original Sixaxis controller.  For me, it is the perfect weight, better than the Sixaxis which I always though was too lite.

I would have hoped they would have fixed a couple of annoyances by now.  First of all, the USB cable is too short.  You won't be able to really play a game while charging your controller unless you don't mind standing right in front of the tv.  They should really make the USB cable longer.  Why in 2008 is Sony still shipping the PS3 with composite cables?  They could have at least shipped it with component video cables.  It could be my imagination but it seems as if my 80GB PS3 is slightler less noisier than the 60GB I own.  I don't know if this means the 80GB uses the smaller cooler cell processor but it would be great if it did.

The 80GB hard drive can really fill up fast but fortunately, Sony was kind enough to allow a user to easily swap the hard drive out for any notebook sized SATA hard drive.  I upgraded my Macbook Pro hard drive to a 320GB hard drive and transferred the old Macbook Pro hard drive to my 60GB Sony PS3.  I may upgrade the hard drive on this 80GB PS3 soon as well.

Some people do not like the fact that the PS3 uses Bluetooth for it's remote contol.  For me, this is better since it allows me to hide the PS3 out of sight where it doesn't clutter up space and also makes the console sound less audible while watching movies or playing games.

In summary, you can't go wrong with the Sony PS3, especially when you order from Amazon.  I also own a Nintendo Wii (sold my Xbox 360 because of the RRoD).  I think it really compliments the Nintendo Wii a lot and fills in where the Nintendo Wii lacks.  Aside from the gripes I made earlier, I also would have preferred if Sony would have upgraded the wireless controller to N instead of G.  This would allow me to stream HD content wirelessly.  But it's not that big of deal because a lot of times, I just copy content to my PS3 hard drive.  Oh yes, I have a large collection of PS2 games and so far, they seem to be working although I have not had a chance to try all of them.",The perfect enterntainment console,1213660800,95,,

I like Mario games similar to SM64 with big levels and variety.  Mario Galaxy was the exact opposite with small similar space based levels.  I also prefer the old controllers over the motion sensitive ones.  I don't want to wave my arms about just to play a video game.  Anyway don't let it be said I don't have an open mind.  Being a long time Nintendo fan I wanted to give it a try and even though I didn't care for it I do think it's a great innovative game for those that like new experiences.  As are all Nintendo's games it was very polished.  The graphics were beautiful and control was spot on.  Nintendo spent a lot time on getting it perfect and they succeeded.

Mobile gaming has come a long way in the past few years. Graphically, they're fast approaching console quality. The only real problem holding them back is touch screen controls. While this input method works fine for games like Temple Run or Angry Birds, trying to play anything more complicated, like a first-person shooter, quickly becomes a painful exercise in futility. PowerA has come to the rescue with a pretty great solution - a few months back, they released the MOGA Pocket Controller, which connected to Android devices via Bluetooth and allowed for a much more natural -- and more importantly, comfortable and precise -- play style. While the MOGA Pocket was a huge step forward in mobile gaming, it wasn't perfect. The MOGA Pro Controller ($49.99) looks to address what small complaints were raised against its little brother, and it definitely succeeds in that regard.

So what improvements have been made? For starters, its design is much more in line with what players would expect from a console controller. In fact, the MOGA Pro feels very much like an Xbox 360 gamepad, with its much larger design, triggers, d-pad, grips, larger buttons, and quality analog sticks. In fact, it's based off of PowerA's award winning FUS1ON Tournament Controller. Beyond this, it has a rechargeable battery and includes a USB charger cable and even a tablet stand. It weighs about two-thirds of the weight of a standard Xbox 360 controller, and is slightly slimmer.

Just like with the MOGA Pocket, the MOGA Pro features a telescoping grip, which holds basically any size smartphone. Anything larger than about 5 inches can be used with the included tablet stand, and works just as well even with the larger distance between the MOGA Pro and the device. The top of the controller has an input for the rechargeable USB, and the back of the device has a recessed button for illuminating the face buttons. A switch located under the arm turns the MOGA Pro on, and switches between the default and HID modes.

Thankfully, PowerA has made setting up and using the MOGA Pro a breeze. You download the MOGA Pivot app, which automatically detects games that can utilize the controller, download your free game, pair the device and you're good to go. It's great that the Pivot app also organizes your game library and lets you know about new games that support the controller.

Hands down, the MOGA Pro is the best mobile gaming controller I've used, and I've found that it enhances my experience with mobile games that support it dramatically. It's unfortunate that it doesn't work with iOS devices, but that's just about the only downside I can think of at this moment. If you want to get the most out of your mobile games, I highly recommend plunking down the $50 for the MOGA Pro.","If you want to get the most out of your mobile games, it's worth plunking down the $50 for the MOGA Pro.",1375056000,4,,

5.0,True,"06 30, 2016",A2PT20HWKO2IQ5,B01DT2H0BW,Aiden,"I first started playing the Atelier series on the PS3 with Atelier Rorona, than was hooked, and bought Totori followed by Atelier Meruru: The Apprentice of Arland, so of course I had to get Sophie and was not disappointed. I missed Atelier Ayesha, Escha & Logy and Shallie since my PS3 died after Meruru and was upgrading to a PS4 at the time. (Can't comment on the last 3 games). Change of pace, light hearted, story character driven, they removed the time limit system from past games which helps you explore and develop characters without having to time every step and not make the days past. Share Play can be used, as well as streaming. No blocked parts.

I'm glad i'm back playing the series. One of the main reasons I like them is the change of pace. It's light hearted game play and nothing overly serious like end of the world scenarios you see in almost every game. Character goals are more important, as well as alchemy and exploring the world and meeting new people. Gust tends to always bring characters from previous games back as cameos. Logy is in this, I know he was from the Escha game and comes back as a sword smith. Pamela has become a recurring character in almost every game (she's also in this). It also helps move the story seeing past characters since you connect with the previous game.. While this may sound tamed or dull to some, it's far from it. It does have special events that pop up that you must beat (monsters, dragons and demons) but story focus is on personal developments and exploring the world around you. It's very story focused with events popping up randomly or on intervals and each person has a 'friendship' meter. Which triggers events tied to them.

Can't compare on the last 3 games fighting system but I do know they removed the ""limit break"" that was present Rorona, Totori and Meruru it was a special skill when a character reached a certain mode which was an ultimate attack and have now fused them into a team type ultimate attack instead on single. Each person does have thier own ultimate, they are just joined by the group present. They still have skills, items like uni bombs, lighting rods etc and the standard, heal, speed up, break, sleep, poison etc. If you're familiar with those (which is standard in most RPGS) it should be simple to jump into. If you're a fan of the series and missed a few games like I did, it should very easy to get use to it again. Alchemy system has been enhanced but for the most parts follows the standard theme. (traits, quality, levels) when mixing. You can still carry over traits like previous games. To people not use to the Atelier series, it may be hard to understand how the story flows since they don't hold your hand, you have to advance the story doing tasks or alchemy but eventually it opens up to character moment to move the story forward. In the status menu section the friendship meter appears in red or black. Some moments in the game require you to talk to characters to trigger events. Most the times it tells you in the ""idea section"" others you have to walk up to characters. They use a day/time system some events only happen at a specific time. This is not a negative, it just needs some getting use to if you're use to these types of games.

Even though I missed the last 3, they still have some of the best music. Everything fits the game perfectly and like previous ones, they include vocal parts on special events. The rest that seem basic, grow on you and you start to appreciate it as time passes. My only regret was not buying the special edition, since I missed the last 3 games I wasn't sure if they could ""hook"" me again.

At first it took some getting used to unlearning what I have learned from playing Jedi Outcast. The first two hours were spent figuring out the gameplay and wondering whether any of this could really be any fun. Frankly it wasn't fun because I was too engrossed with figuring out the gameplay.
BUT! once I figured it out, I couldn't stop playing the game!!!! It is so incredibly addictive. I keep telling myself, ""I'm just going to walk down this one corridor and I'm going to quit and make dinner."" -- Dinner finally got made, 4 hours later!
Pros:
Graphics is spectacular. Worthy of the Xbox's capabilities. The images you see on the web site is what you get in the game.
There is great facial animation when your character is engaged in a dialog. They switch camera views throughout a dialog sequence. These are all typical camera techniques from TV and movies but rearly get put into RPG dialogs.
When you run thru a field, the plants part and then slowly fall back into place. Not necessary but a beautiful addition.
Voice talent is superb. Even when the aliens speak in alien tongue you can tell from their intonation when they are speaking positively or negatively.
Very easy to learn interface, even for a non RPGer. Tutorial weaves perfectly into the game.
Which brings me to the 3rd major pro- the game has a very engaging storyline and quests that seem to fold well into the overall storyline. Some quests are not required but do seem to make sense in the overall storyline. I will probably play this game from the beginning again so I can try fulfilling those quests that I missed.
Gameplay is essentially turn-based but it means it frees you up to manage each of your characters during combat. This is important if you are to win against a strong opponent. The interface will let you chain a sequence of actions by using the X button. This is not in the intro tutorial but is in the manual.

I tend to like wireless headsets when I am gaming on a console.  Mainly that is because the even if I use a wired headset I am typically connecting through my wireless controller anyways.

However, when gaming on my PC I use a wired headset, and out of all the wired headsets I have used this one is by far the best.  First, I have a very large head and this set when set to its largest size fits me comfortably.  Which is rare when it comes to gaming headsets.

The ear cushions are simply the softest I have ever worn.  Like a soft memory foam that contours perfectly to the sides of my head.  Great at isolating outside noise and yet it still stays cool and you have no ear sweat.  Also, if you wear glasses the cushions have soft spots to allow them to contour around the glasses, so it doesnt squeeze your head, I like it so that I can use some digital glasses I have that reduce eye strain.

The sound, is freakin amazing.  In playing games it is clear, crisp and distortion free.  You can hear quiet footsteps, and you can hear loud rumbling bass equally well.  And then if you just want to listen to music with these bad boys you will be impressed I promise.  Everything sounds great with this headphones, form Jazz to Death Metal.  I kind of love them for their sound quality.

The microphone is removable and pretty good.  Slightly above average if you compare it with others.  No complaints but no one ever said it made me sound great.  It is fairly flexible, it will stay in place and it is removable.

As far as control for the headset go there really are none.  On the cord you have a mic on and off switch and that is it.  Any other control you have to do through your hardware, which in the end is fine I guess.

But the sound and fit on these is killer and that is the reason you should get them.  Highly recommended.",Best Sounding Best Feeling Headset I Ever Used,1464566400,,{'Edition:': ' Elite Pro Headset'},

-Its tedious assigning settlers to given tasks (like farming)
-Ran into one environment glitch were I was stuck and couldn't move.  Had to restart from a previous save which was rather annoying.
-Early on I was quite frustrated at the number of grenades that got thrown by the enemy.

Every possible area in need of improvement was addressed the second time around. And every area that defined the brilliance of the original was maintained and perfected. This was a great relief for me (considering the large number of improvements); I was worried that perhaps Bioware would not only changes the negative aspects of the game, but also the positive. Rest assured, this could not be further from the truth. The entire game is like a single defining emotion... I call it ""Mass Effection"". I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, which is why I'm going to cut this short, but just keep in mind that your choices from the first game will have an even greater impact on the game than you think. In conclusion, the Story, Writing, Combat, Music, Characters, Dialogue, Sidequests, Controls, and Visuals (oh God, the graphics!) have been slowly crafted to perfection. I have no doubts that this game will be successful both critically and commercially. If it were possible to give this game 6 stars, I would it. Unfortunately, such an option would defy Amazon's very existance, causing an unbalance in the force. Or... the universe. Which is exactly what Mass Effect 2 did to my freaking mind.

You only experience the loading screen when you first boot up the game and when you die (and your deaths take place 15-20 minutes apart).

Even better is that From Software is now working on a patch to decrease the loading time.

But luckily for you if you didn't play it it has gone down in price to be a real bargain. Even if this wasn't the case I would highly recommend Dark Void. I'll quickly list of some key elements to help you decide if it is for you.

-The gameplay breaks up into 3rd person shooter and aerial combat sequences (and sometimes a mix of both). This is great because it breaks up the monotony, so you aren't doing the same thing all the time.

-3rd person combat is pretty standard for modern games (cover system, only carry 2 weapons + grenades at a time) but the maps are varied enough to keep things interesting.

-Jetpack gameplay is tricky but mastering it is a rewarding challenge. It took me a Long time before I felt I knew what I was doing in this part of the game, but by the end I was doing all kinds of crazy maneuvers and feeling like I had really accomplished something. I suggest you try the demo on the PSN (it took me about a dozen tries before I got a hang of the jetpack and beat the demo). If you absolutely can't handle the flight controls you will hate the game.

-The Maps are Huge! The game engine can handle very large maps which means you can cover a lot of ground in a mission with no loading, which is always nice. It also means you are often allowed a lot of freedom to accomplish goals depending on your play style. The maps are also quite different. Temples, jungle, strange rock formations, giant futuristic bases. Not to mention the layout is very well done, keeping the flow of action and direction of player movement varied. There were some missions where I couldn't believe how much was going on.

-The story rips on a lot of classic b-movie science fiction themes which often goes in the direction of ridiculous and cheesy without ruining the plot. The main story is entertaining enough but you will either roll your eyes or laugh (or both) at some of the background stuff. I rather enjoyed that.

A quite expansive and interesting expansion that shows that once again, Bethesda is one of the masters of post base game content. I'm sure patches were needed, but when I downloaded it and started playing, it was seamless. I didn't have to turn off the fog or anythign either. Perhaps I was lucky. Dunno.

Anyway, the overarching story in Far Harbor was interesting and fun to play through, and all the little side quests, miscellaneous quests, and the small quests you find that don't end up in your quest log really added up to a stellar experience. The new companion was cool, although I did still favor Curie and Nick in the end.

The actual setting was awesome. A foreboding, radiation fog filled island with three major factions and plenty of raiders as well (called trappers on the island). Cool new critters to kill, who, by and by, are much tougher than the average wasteland critter. Expect most everything to be able to stand up to a deathclaw and plan accordingly, lol.

The graphics looked great, and I actually thought the animations looked improved over the base game as well.

The gameplay otherwise was essentially the same. I had so many fusion cores stocked up that I basically stayed in my sweet X-01 power armor the whole time, but I think you will manage without it if you need to. That said, power armor is still the way to go. I was level 68 when I wrapped up the main portion of the island and there were still plenty of challenging battles to be had. You will also start settlements if you are so inclined just like on the mainland, and if you also own the other DLC, you can craft robots and set up fight clubs to your hearts content. You can also link the settlements on the island to your settlements on the mainland via trade routes. Your settlements will populate much more slowly however, so be mindful of that. There is a very cool trader on the island who also trains guard dogs that you can buy and send to your settlements to help with their defense.

So, was Far Harbor worth the price of entry? Easily. I'd say I got more value out of this expansion that I do out of most AAA titles on their own. If you plan to spend copious amounts of time in the the Commonwealth, you should definitely get this DLC. You can wander back and forth between the island and the mainland to your hearts content as well, and many quests on one or the other impact things in both places. btw....I recommend taking Nick along with you to begin Far Harbor. His origin story sees greater clarity for some of the dialogue and holotapes on the island.",One of the great expansions out there.,1465603200,10,"{'Edition:': ' Far Harbor', 'Platform:': ' PS4 Digital Code'}",

I admit I'm not a majong fan, so that game I cant really review, as I never play it. But i'm sure for majong fans they shouldn't find any problem with it. The one I play most is JQ Solitaire. If you are familiar with online games such as Scarab Solitaire, or variations of the game, then this is what JQ Solitaire is. It is not the kind of solitaire you find on every PC, it is a much more fun game and each level the cards are set out differently to keep you from getting bored with the same old layouts. Once you complete the set, if you haven't found all the gold that you find in the game, you get to play a jewel quest type of game to see if you can make up the lost spaces. So it initially contains a sort of mini game in between levels that is simmilar to Expeditions; which is the other game on here. Expeditions is something very simmilar to Jewel Quest that I'm sure most of you have heard of. Those 2 games alone I give full scores to.

I can't really think of any downsides to the game, everything works fine, it's fun, it has plenty of hours of levels to keep you playing. I guess the only thing I could say i'd give the thumbs down to is the company logo/ads when you turn the game on, although, there is plenty of worse ones, as these only last abut 10 seconds maybe, so it's not too bad.

Somewhere out there in the nether regions, but it's solid in the same way that DOOM's was (though there are lenghty writeups for the story, history, and characters that inhabit the game world at Croteam's website, if you're so inclined to spend half an hour) with a minimally invasive plotline.
Sounds? More than auditory filler; enjoyable to listen to indeed. The sound effects are pretty awesome: grabbing a +100 life heart fills the air with an onimous (yet comical, in its own way) fading noise that works exceptionally well in conjunction with the doors closing about you and the light fading.
Sam's scenery and sights are wonderfully scenic and impressive both due to and in spite of their huge size and low polygon count: Croteam sure knows architecture. In this title they've even thrown in a large number of plants that may prove to be deadly in one form or another. Even without the non-stop show special effects seen in the original Serious Sam demo, the game seems more impressive than more densely built, smoother looking FPS titles thanks to its sense of scale and the frenzied pace of its battles.
Sam arguably outdoes Rise of the Triad in terms of plain fun and wackiness--but here it's not just buried in deathmatch or cheats and command line parameters. Sam is crazy ALL the time. Lots of stuff done here has been seen before in Duke Nukem--from the ubiquitous voice-overs to the movie set in a room, but here it meshes into the product and is quite a bit more easygoing. It's a telling point that where 3D Realms would make a gigantic alien with rockets, Croteam would build a mechanical, hugely stereoid dependent chicken of roughly the same size--and then throw 5 of them at you in a field, along with a hundred lesser enemies.
Play this game co-op, turn on Infinite Ammo if you're so inclined, Extra enemies, and of course diallow clients pausing the game. While I do have issues with the complexity of the administrative control, co-op is often a very smooth affair on a good connection. Competitiveness in Serious Co-op is simply everybody running around showing each other where the secrets are while trying to bag more than their share of the monsters, and this experience should not be missed by any. There aren't campers, PKs, item thieves or smacktards in Serious Sam. The game's general tone, as it works out, is less like two birds at the same feeder than DOOM and more rewarding for people to come to another's aid--since you have to go that way in any case.

Story: Sonic the Hedgehog celebrates his birthday with his friends, a mysterious being known as the Time Eater suddenly appears, destroying the party and sucking everyone through various ""time holes"", scattering them across different points in history. Sonic tries to stop him, but the monster easily knocks him out. After regaining consciousness, Sonic finds himself in a strange dimension known as White Space, a realm where time and space end up after they have been 'erased' by being drained of color and life. Sonic rescues his sidekick, Miles ""Tails"" Prower, and as they search for their friends, they encounter versions of themselves from the past, referred to as ""Classic Sonic"" and ""Classic Tails"", who are depicted with the appearance and proportions used in concept art from the Sega Genesis era of Sonic games. As the two Tails determine that Time Eater's actions are damaging time and space itself, both Classic and ""Modern"" Sonic race through their history, restoring time to normal and rescuing their friends.

After restoring the worlds and collecting all the Chaos Emeralds, they discover that the mastermind behind the now perfected Time Eater is none other than Sonic's eternal nemesis, Doctor Eggman, and his own classic self. It is revealed that while drifting through space following the events of Sonic Colors, Eggman discovered the Time Eater and decided to join forces with his past self to harness its power, complete the Time Eater Robot and erase his past defeats from history. Although the Time Eater manages to overwhelm the two Sonics, the support of their friends and the power of the Chaos Emeralds allow them to transform into their Super forms and defeat both versions of Eggman. With the Time Eater destroyed, time and space are restored and the group returns to the present and finally finishes celebrating Sonic's birthday. After the party, Classic Sonic and Classic Tails travel back to their proper time as everyone says their farewells.

In a post-credits scene, both versions of Eggman find themselves stuck in White Space after the Time Eater's defeat, with seemingly no way out

You moved from a rather hip and happening city to go to a school back in your boring little hometown just because your favorite photographer is now a teacher there. Your life is more or less a day to day repeat of Degrassi High without Drake. Until one day you happen to be in the right place at the right time and discover you're a living time machine.

Welcome to Life is Strange, an episodic ""interactive movie"" as I've started to call them. It's pretty similar to TellTale's recent adventure games where you control a character to explore your environment, interact with other characters, and make major story affecting decisions such as whether you want to eat waffles or eggs and bacon for breakfast.

Okay, it does sound rather silly. And the first episode DOES give off a pretty bad impression. As previously mentioned, it starts off almost like a 2015 High School simulator. But by the end of episode one, you gather enough hints to figure out some major  is going down. Each episode since has only traveled further down that rabbit hole. Decisions get much more important, and you may find yourself using the token 'rewind' system to change your decisions in case your consciousness gets the better of you.

Of course, no game is without it's flaws, and Life is Strange has a few I'd rather forget about. The dialogue itself is very ""older men trying to emulate teenage girls they've seen talking on Twitter/Tumblr/Instagram"" and can lead to HELLA cringe worthy moments. The controls can be a bit twitchy at times, and you'll find yourself trying to readjust your positioning just to get an option to light up for you. But the overall story is pretty damn interesting and fun. There are plenty of references to classic cult tv shows and movies like Twin Peaks, Donnie Darko, Butterfly Effect, Twilight Zone, even Planet of the Apes! And the plot itself seems to borrow elements from these sources as well.

Edit: Now that the final episode is out, I can say that I still feel the game was worth my time and money. The ending has left fans very divided, but I myself enjoyed it. Without spoiling too much, just keep in mind that this IS a Time Travel story, and they don't tend to get ""happy endings"". My only REAL complaint about the game is that, like TellTale's recent games, your choices... don't make too much actual impact. That's the one downfall of this whole ""Interactive Movie"" genre, and I wish it could be properly solved. Maybe one day.

I'd still say if you're a fan of recent TellTale games, or time travel stories, or melodramatic entertainment? Give it a shot. If you don't like it, you can always just rewind time to before you bought it. Right?

The digital version of this game can be purchased for $19.99 on PC/XBLA/PSN for the core game. The boxed edition is $39.99, but comes with a Season Pass for 6 DLC Packs.

Pros:

 Insanely fun and addictive gameplay

 Gorgeous graphics & a wide variety of futuristic environments

 Great soundtrack

 Track Editor and unlockables add a lot of replay value.

 Skill Challenges & FMX tracks are a blast.

 The game's quirky sense of humor is reminiscent of the Ratchet & Clank series.

Cons:

 Due to the ability to instantly restart the level or a checkpoint without a load screen, the textures don't always load in fast enough.

Conclusion:

  Trials Fusion is a wonderful edition to the content-starved PS4 and Xbox One. It's a game you can mess up on 70 times in a row and still have fun while failing.
  Highly recommend to any gamer who owns a next gen console or PC.

5.0,False,"12 5, 2003",A4NRFON6WHWNW,B00008XKZM,Amazon Customer,"I wrote a review giving this game two stars a while back since the game kept crashing on me and loaded very slowly.  Otherwise I think this game would have won the prize for best RPG or one ot the best games period ever produced.  Obviously I was upset.  I had similar problems, but with only certain games, like ghost recon (bummer).
Someone recommended getting an xbox with a different kind of DVD drive (not a Thompson).  The problem was solved.  I have played all my games through from start to end without any problems. (Now I am a happy gamer).
Back to this game:
Pros:  1. If you like Marrowind, and it is hard not to, you will like this game more.  A self contained game (you don't need the original Marrowind to play this game) where they take the game Marrowind and throw in two more great inter-related games (Bloodmoon and Tribunal), which basically makes your old Marrowind game that you may have come to love 3 times longer and much better.
2. Better sound effects: especially with the Hungers (they really growl now and add more special effects)
3. Whenever you want, you can switch between games, making the 3 games one great big game.  Better to wait, starting with the original Marrowind game until you have a strong player with high stats and weapons.
4. You can keep your old Marrowind character saved on xbox and use it in the ""game of the year edition"".  I really think though it is cleaner to start a new character using the new game.
5. For the price, this is the best new game, in my opinion, on the market today- period.
Cons:
1. No major cons, but it cracks me up when the writing of what people say is completely different from what is actually spoken.  For example, you just saved the world, and someone's life, and the writing says something like, ""Thanks for being a great hero and for everything we all owe you our lives..."", but the voice says, ""Annoying Outlander"".
2. No other cons

www.amazon.com/Crystal-Hard-Case-Cover-Nintendo/dp/B0010LC6QE/

With the new 3DS XL, I wanted to keep it in this travel case below.  Even though it is listed as for the DSi, it fits the 3DS XL just fine.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Official-Nintendo-Travel-Case-DSi-DS/dp/B0035LBLVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Official Nintendo Travel Case DSi DS</a>

The Duraflexi protector is made from TPU material, part of the reason I chose this is from my previous experience with TPU cover for smartphones.  The material surface is in between a smooth surface like polycarbonate (slippery) and silicone (high grip).  Perfect because you don't lose the grip easily AND it doesn't feel like silicone, where it's hard to put in and take out of pockets/purses/bags and collects lint/hair.  It is also in between as far as flexibility, not stiff like polycarbonate and not limp like silicone.  Very easy to slip on the 3DS XL and it doesn't fall off once on.  It's also low profile, it does not protrude out much like some other protectors.

Perfect type of protector for our family.  We mainly wanted some protection from a slight drop (low height), protection from dirty/oils from hands, and protection from scratches.  This fits the check list.  It does NOT protect the two buttons on the corners so if you need/want full protection, do not buy this one.  I can recommend this to someone who maintains their gadgets gently, mainly uses it sitting, etc.  If you are rather abusive in handling things, frequently on the move with the 3DS XL, or have active children, I recommend something else, like the NERF protector, for example.

I knew I wouldn't be able to use a similar clear polycarbonate cover AND fit it into the travel case because polycarbonate had a hinge.  This Duraflexi protector doesn't and it appears to be pretty slim.  I ordered and I can say I am pleasantly pleased that I can still use both the cover and the case.  It is a tight squeeze and the way I put it in the travel case is upside down with the buttons towards me.  I reviewed the DSi travel case as well separately.

UPDATE 11/3/13: It's still holding well, very easy to hold and slim, one small minor issue is the edge of the corners for the bottom portion 'may' be a little annoying to some users.  It is very minor but I will explain; it is right where your left and right thumb areas are, I find it more so for the right thumb.  The right thumb hovers over the X/Y/A/B buttons and the A button is very close to the right edge of the protector.

Sometimes when I play, I feel my thumb 'pulling/rubbing/stretching' against the right edge of the protector.  Over time, can this cause the right corner bend slightly outwards?  It hasn't yet and I do recall touching that edge near the very beginning of owning the protector.  I don't recall it much now, maybe I got used to it or it was certain games played.

*** Please see the comment left in this review by another member, that member provides some good information regarding this and other types of protectors.

[...], it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.",Really nice cover for the 3DS XL,1377475200,147,{'Color:': ' Red'},

My hands sometimes shake when I play this game, but that's what makes it so exciting! This game is defiantly not for the kiddies. It's got some areas that scare the hell out of me, and I'm 16! I've divided all the major points of this game into the sections below.
Graphics- These graphics are so great you'll get teary eyed!  The graphics look like they were meant for Toy Story!
Sound- The sound is clear as a bell. You can hear the footstep of a zombie from rooms away. Plus, the music is so creepy you'll never feel safe anywhere in the mansion!
Horror Factor- Since the graphics in this game are so realistic the monsters look so scary you'll be afraid to even approach one! Plus the sounds like doors opening in the distance or the floor squeeking adds a lot of pressure to the game. From this game i quote ""Fight your fears and survive""
Controls- The controls are similar in style to Play Station's versions. You need to press a button to raise your weapon, and another to fire it. No big problem but I strongly recommend using Controller Configuration C.  It's the simplest most practical of the three settings.
Difficulty- This game is no walk in the park. You can choose in the beginning to play in hard or normal mode. Honestly they're both nightmares to get through! You really need to know the controls like the back of your hand if you want to survive! A very scary and pressure added feature in this re-make is the new abilities of the zombies. If you don't kill the zombie by shooting it in the head, it becomes faster and more powerful each time it gets back up! That ought to keep you on your toes!
Replay Value- This game is so huge its almost impossible to get everything one time through. Plus, since you can play as one of two characters, each has his or her own different storyline. You have to finish the game with each character to see the complete story so this game has very high replay value.
Wrap Up- This game is the crowning achievement of the Game Cube! It is incredible in every way and no doubt will become a classic! Just a warning, for those of you who scare easily or are squeamish to gore, you might want to pass off this game, but if your not, prepare to enter the survival horror...","""Enter the Survival Horror""",1021680000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"02 19, 2014",A3LR81AANUOKXW,B00DS0MQUQ,SRS47,"I got the game when it came out on October 29, 2013 on PS3. I had plenty of issues with this game just like other players. So, I was hopping PS4 version solves some of the issues. Time passed by and I finally decided to write a review about this game because I think EA/Dice had enough time to fix things.
Issue #1: Single player save games delete by itself. I was trying to get some dog tags for MP that can only be unlocked by playing SP and finding them around levels, but all my saves were gone.
Issue #2: Constant updates and game changes. I follow BF on twitter & Facebook, and pretty much every month there is something changing. Like added recoil to X gun, decrease damage to Y tank,... So, I really need to relearn things every time I play.
Issue #3: Playing with your clan or friends is a pain in the ass.
Issue #4: No customization allowed in the game menu. Only by joining a server or playing test range.
Issue#5: CRRRAAAZZZZYYY LAG. I never ever thought I would say this about BF. Sometimes the lag is so bad that you can't play at all. People jump around, rubber banding, and bad net code makes SOME games unplayable. Some servers are ok ( 4/10 games that I play are good)
Issue#6: This one is a personal opinion. I think BF community has changed and they are more COD players in BF than before. As a BF player since 2005 on PC, I can tell you team work is getting weak in BF4.
Issue #7: LAAAAGGG. It's so annoying that I have to mention it again. People join U.S servers from all over the world. Last night I was in a server with people from Germany, France, and Canada. No wonder the game lags...
Issue #8: Map design is not as strong as BF3. I literally loved all BF3 maps( from CQ maps to huge maps like Alborz mountain), but BF4 has a couple of really bad maps that I just quit when I end up in them.
Issue#9: Zero health kills. This happens a lot to me. I see an enemy, shoot him 12-15 bullets and I get some hit marks, he shoots like 2-3 bullets with an Assault rifle with no attachment and I'm DEAD. I look at his health and it shows ZERO. I know it's a glitch or net coding problem and he actually has 2-3 health left, but I'm damn sure he should have been killed.
Issue#10: Dog tags are ugly and shows nothing about your skills. In BF3 we had dog tags that showed amount of kills that you got by a particular gun or equipment. My favorite was MVP( most valued player which I got it like 370 times ). I was really good to show your skills in your dog tag, but it's all gone in BF4.

Of course there are many positive things in this game like graphic/ Guns/ Attachments/ Huge maps/ 64 players/dynamic maps...
This game needs updates & fixes. Net coding problem needs to be solved. Region lock MUST be in this game ( US players in US servers, Canadians in Canadian Servers ).
Anyway, I recommend this game if it's cheap. I would say wait a little longer till they fix more issues.

If I could give this game 4.5 stars I would as I believe it's a more accurate review of the game. There are plenty of amazing things to be said about this game, so I'll list out the few main bad so the user is aware.

First, there are very few maps in comparison to Halo Wars 1 (more on that game in a bit). Because of that, the game gets somewhat repetitive as you're constantly seeing the same maps over and over again. Also, the maps have very little differences, again promoting the repetitive gameplay.

There are some minor detail issues with this game that cause concern. The UNSC Scorpion tanks hardly resemble the Scorpion tanks Halo fans have grown to love. Additionally, the campaign of this game ends on a huge cliffhanger which is frustrating, especially after the ending we got in Halo 5. HOPEFULLY, there will be a Halo Wars 3 which is the only explanation for the ending of the game.

Now onto the bundled Halo Wars: Definitive Edition. If you have not yet played Halo Wars 1, the definitive edition of the game is definitely the version to play - for the single player campaign.

5.0,False,"04 6, 2008",A14NA0W8ESGDSI,B00005LOXE,T.L.,"Since this is a compilation game that consists of two games I'll review them separately.

First, before that, I just want to remark that these two games were perhaps the two of the greatest RPGs to hit the SNES in America. Final Fantasy IV was marketed to the American audience as Final Fantasy 2 and Chrono Trigger is often called the best RPG ever created and has a fan base larger than many of the big hits of today.

Final Fantasy IV:
-----------------------------
Final Fantasy IV (or 2 American) is definitely one of the more interesting storylines and is as exciting to play now as it was back when it was first created. The general story revolves around one man's quest to understand himself and in the process atone for his sins committed in the past.

It's different than the usual Final Fantasy's in that characters who are in your party leave and come back throughout the storyline but you never have the ability to select your own party. So one character may run off to do something and you'll quickly have him replaced by another.

It definitely removes the need to switch around characters to level them all up but when you get stuck with characters you may find goofy (cough Cid, cough) you're stuck with them until the story progresses.

The most groundbreaking thing about the story, which never really happens in RPGs these days so much was that characters in the story may die at times (as part of the story). It's just something that most stories today shy away from but playing through Final Fantasy IV I never knew if I'd lose someone in my team and it always made me cling to the story hoping for the best even when put into impossible situations in the story.

Pros:
The game's major flaw was how slow your character moved. That one tiny enhancement makes a world of a difference playing.
Same great story.

Cons:
It still uses the old four block save system. How does this translate to the playstation saves? You have to save this gigantic file onto your memory card and then inside of that file save on one of the four saves. It just doesn't make sense why they didn't update that. It's a slow process to save as well.
-----------------------------

Chrono Trigger
-----------------------------
Had this game been released without any changes, it likely would have been fine as it was. Still the CG movies added to it are somewhat interesting.

The game revolves around an interesting story dealing with time travel and brings you to the edge of your morality as you understand the complex interactions between the characters. As you begin to unravel the story you instantly remember pieces of it unveiled earlier and begin to make connections, something most stories in RPGs today lack as well.

Another fun piece of the game was the multiple endings it had. This isn't like Final Fantasy X-2's good or bad ending style but a unique ending system that involved how you went about beating it and at what point in the game you were at when you beat it.

For example, one ending, if you beat it before completing one storyline, caused the world to become an imp only world where they lived like humans do. It's just a fun game all around.

Pros:
Great game, I don't even need to list these, an amazing piece to add to your collection.

Cons:

Metal Gear Solid is just awesome. The graphics are just unbelievable, or should that be ""to believable."" The game play just drags you in and keeps you going. I love the fact that they stick with the same 3D generating with the movies. Not switching to some other rendering of the characters and environment. It keeps the flow of the game smoother.

The PS2 and PS game compatibility is the main reason I went for the 80GB. I did not want to have to keep my PS2 running just to continue playing its games. The wireless controller and virtual memory cards make it much nicer than the PS2 system. Then only draw back is having to get the memory card adapter to move saved games to the PS3.

The Blu-Ray player is sweet. I replaced a SD DVD player. The PS3 does a great job of upconverting DVDs. The bluetooth remote is a must have if you will be watching movies.

I networked it with my PC and have shared my music, movies, and pictures. Works great to listen to music and view pictures.

Much like the cases you may find for Apple Products (ipod, iphone, ipad, etc.) However, that dosent mean you're not getting a bad deal. A simple case like this does wonders for gamers of all kinds.

Good:
- Reduces sweat and oils from the skin. The standard plastic shell seems to conduct heat much more easily than this material, so it's a great product if you're looking to reduce the amount of sweat or oils that come from you'r skin.

-Fits perfectly. It's a snug fit, and grips to the controller so you don't have to worry about it moving around very much, if at all.

-Feels great. Even though your just putting a case over you'r controller, it makes a huge difference in how the controller feels. It gives it some grip, slight padding, and makes the controller slightly thicker to fill in the gaps of straining fingers.

-Durable. It's roughly a cm thick and lasts forever, I've had this product for a long time and it still looks brand new, cleanse easy, dosent tear, looks great.

BADS

-Installation. To put the case on you have to stretch it over the handles, and slide it into place, and for some people it can be rather intimidating. You obviously do not want to tear the product so you have to be careful putting it on, but once you put it on, its practically Flawless

Overall: If your looking to customize your controller, or just give your controller a better feel it is definetely worth the money and something you could easily just throw into your list to minimize the shipping cost.

Song Selection:  The song selection included many of my favorite Beatle tunes.  I'm sure we could all make our own list of 10-20 songs we wish had been in the game, so I won't bore you with mine, but if you can connect to XBox Live (or PSN for folks with that version) you'll be able to fill in some of the gaps over the next few months.  The full Abbey Road and Rubber Soul albums are confirmed to be upcoming as downloadable content, expect them to cost about $15 each.

Music Quality: It's the Beatles!  And it sounds terrific.  The game uses the new mixes of all the albums which were released today along with the game.  The only time I noticed a real distracting difference is that the strings in ""Hello Goodbye"" seem to be much more prominent, and I personally didn't care for it.  But that's a minor gripe.

Game Difficulty: There was alot of discussion that the game would be too easy for veteran music game players.  I was actually pleasantly surprised by the interesting charts on guitar and bass.  True, there are no real scorchers in here of the likes of ""Free Bird"" or ""Painkiller"" from previous Harmonix music games.  But there is a pretty good mix of songs across most of the difficulty spectrum, with some potentially challenging riffs and interesting hammer-on parts (""Octopus' Garden"" and ""Dear Prudence"" stand out in that last category.)  Also, as most of the songs are 2-3 minutes long, the total possible score is lower than on many modern songs in other games, and therefore the margin of error for getting Gold Stars is much tighter and earning them is more of a challenge.

Presentation:  The animated musical sequences at the beginning and end of the game are beautifully crafted.  Most of the songs from the Beatles' studio period have fantasy/psychedelic videos playing behind the note chart which look very nice as well, though I'm usually too honed in on the chart to notice them.  On the menu navigation side, I liked the improvements in the quickplay menu over that in Rock Band 2.  You will now see your personal best score AND how many stars you earned for that score next to the song name, so if you want to go back and gold star everything you can see what you're missing.  It also shows you your overall ranking and ranking among your friends for each song when you're highiighting it.  I have one other minor gripe with the game, and that is that while they took care not to put the ""ding"" sound effect for earning a star while playing, and they eliminated the ability to bend notes (you can still do it for star power, here called ""beatlemania"", but it won't affect the sound of the track), they put in a sound effect for earning and using star power.  It's only noticeable in the studio songs, as the live ones instead increase the volume of the screaming fans when you do so.  Minor gripe, but I'd wish I could turn it off to get the pure Beatles track without the little ""swoosh"" sound every so often.

Extras:  By playing through the story you unlock Beatles photos, which can be viewed from the main menu and are accompanied by a paragraph of text describing the historial context of the photo.  You also unlock ""prizes"" that can be viewed or listened to, including the Beatles Christmas Album and a clip from the concert at Shea Stadium (named of course for the famous Cuban guerilla leader, Che Stadium... oh wait that was the Rutles).  As far as gameplay-related extras are concerned, there are a number of achievements on the XBox version (and I assume trophies on the PS3 version) encouraging you to meet certain goals within certain songs, such as getting a long note streak or hitting all the hammer-ons without strumming any of them.  You can also play through challenges to unlock new gamer pics and in-game icons.

Overall I'm quite pleased with this game both as a Beatles fan and as a fan of the Rock Band music games.  I certainly hope it does well enough in sales to justify Harmonix adding the rest of the Beatles songlist as downloadable content over the next year.","A great Beatles experience, AND a great Rock Band experience",1252454400,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Its a game that starts a little harder and as you unlock abilities you truly see just how much Talion kicks butt! This is a great game to own.

The Chinese company 1stPlayer has created a masterpiece, While I have one minor complaint I fell in love with the FIREROSE keyboard from the start. The blue Outemu switches included have a tactile bump at actuation which actually feels nice while you're typing. I  pulled the Corsair K70 RGB with Cherry MX Red switches out of my setup when the keyboard arrived so I could receive a better feel for this review. I have gamed with it, checked social media, typed documents, and browsed the web. The complaint I have is with the chroma lighting. While the lighting is back-lit the only mode is breathing or standing still I would have like to see a rainbow or software to change the colors. That being said, I tested the IPX7 Certification by pouring an entire water bottle on the keyboard (spreaded out, 16.9 Fl OZ) Not one part of the keyboard broke/malfunctioned/died. The water actually just poured right out. The build quality on the Chinese made keyboard surprised me, it was actually really great. While I do miss the wrist wrest of the K70 I am still in love with the key switches and the beautiful white paint. I enjoy the minimalist look of not having a top plate.

5.0,True,"04 17, 2012",A2P8I8YWN5JTB2,B0057PERIY,Wayne Crenshaw,"Ever since I watched Battle 360 on the History Channel, I have longed for someone to make a video game that would allow me to swoop down on a Japanese aircraft carrier in my Dauntless and drop a bomb right on its deck. About one day after getting Birds of Steel in the mail, that's exactly what I was doing, so thanks Konami.
The downside is that I got this game on a Friday, and by Sunday night I had finished it, with about 10 hours of play. I still feel it was worth the money, however.
It's difficulty levels are simplified, realistic and simulator. I started in realistic, but after a couple of hours of getting shot down, crashing, and having my plane spin out uncontrollably, I started over in simplified. It's still fairly challenging, and very challenging at times, but more doable, so unless you think you are a real hot shot, I suggest starting with simplified.
Now I am going back through it in the realistic level, and find it easier. Not sure I could ever do simulator, since that doesn't even let you see your altitude or your engine speed.
This game is made about as realistic as I suppose a video flight game can be. Obviously real pilots wouldn't have large yellow circles in the sky to show them where they are supposed to go, or red arrows pointing to enemy planes and ships, but I don't see how you would otherwise ever be able to tell enemy planes from friendly when they are diving all around you like a bee swarm.
But the best thing I like about it is that it's an excellent interactive history lesson. I wish more combat video games would be like this. Unfortunately, the majority these days seem to be geared primarily for teenagers, who apparently prefer to listen to a lot cornball dialogue from cliche characters, and aren't usually even based on actual battles.
One tip: At times it can be confusing what you are supposed to do. I realize now this is really what led to my difficulties in the first try on realistic. Starting at Wake Island, you will go out and there will be many enemy ships, and all these red arrows are pointing to them. However there are two specific ships you are supposed to hit so those are the only ones to worry about. You can identify them by hitting the O button for the radar, and the targets you are supposed to hit will be in bright red. Go for those.
Overall, this is a very good game and I am going to take a look at more Konami titles.",Excellent game,1334620800,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

It's fun, easy to learn, difficult to master, challenging, frustrating, rewarding and extremely inventive -- everything you could want in a video game.  Plus, it's full of so many tasks, ranging from fairly easy to EXTREMELY challenging, that even if you only have a few minutes to play, you can sit down and accomplish something, then move on to the harder tasks when you have time.
The most amazing thing about this game is how totally huge it is.  There are more levels and more goals than ever before.  And the replay value is incredible.  Even when you've finished the game (and good luck with that!), you can play again with one of the other skaters and have new goals to accomplish.  Plus you can go back and try to get all the gaps and cash you missed along the way.  The menus even include screens where you can monitor your progress in getting the gaps.
Be warned, if you're a perfectionist, you could spend the rest of your life trying to complete everything in this game.  The rest of us will have to be content knowing we've played MOST of it.
If you've enjoyed the other Tony Hawk games, this is a no brainer.  Buy THPS4 NOW!  If you've never played one, you're missing out on what's probably the greatest gaming experience on the market today.  You should also buy THPS4 NOW!

I had no idea of what was to come when playing this and HOLY WHOA!!! This game is truly among the most disturbing and terrifying games I've ever played on the xbox 360 and surpassing what I felt when I first played the original Quake, Doom, and even Mortal Kombat games back in the 1990s. This game, known as ""Dead Space"" to me is a brilliant cross between Resident Evil, The Thing (1982), and the 1997 movie ""Event Horizon"".

 This game is of a story of a planet-cracking mining ship called the USS Ishimura that had a crew of over 1000 but then contact with it was lost after it encountered an alien artifact called The Marker. A team comprised of protaganist Isaac and several others are sent to investigate and search the ship for survivors as they are unable to establish contact with the ship. What they discover is horror beyond imagination.

 This game truly is among the best games ever made but man oh man, it truly is one of the few games that I can say truly scared the daylights out of me. Enemies will spring out with no warning, in darkness, in poor light, and through any opening imaginable. They are truly frightening, ruthless, and horrifying on every level.

 Play this game on a dark, rainy or stormy night, or late at night, with the lights turned off, and the volume up loud. Whatever you do, prepare yourself for real frights and galore. I've never felt so disturbed or scared by a video game, not even by Resident Evil, Quake or Doom. And because of it, ""Dead Space"" and it's sequel are among the best games ever for the PS3 or Xbox 360!

Those whom are, simply must not meet the requirements with their computer to play this game.  Unlike TS2 it requires much more to run the game.

The graphics are simply beautiful.  A major improvement from the previous sims.  So much more control over what you do, what you want you're sim to like and dislike.  No more load times to visit another lot and many things to do outside the home.
The possibilities are quite endless.

The newest thing is the progression of TS3.  Now you're neighbors and friends will also age as you do, they will get married, have kids, grow old and die.  I think that adds quite a bit to the realism of the game.

There are many things that give this game an advantage over Ages. To me, this was as good an introduction to the entire Zelda saga as I could have imagined, although the very first one probably would have been helpful too :). Anyways, I found that everything in this game was easy to understand and to follow, and I picked up on the gameplay very quickly. If I had started with Ages, I would have been left in the dark and become discouraged.
The people are much nicer to talk to in Seasons, and that makes it easier, knowing that going up to someone in the game, you will probably get a kind response. Not so in Ages, as some (maybe even most) of the people are surly in response, which I did not find very appealing.
One of the most blatant benefits of the game is that there are four different variations to each tile, Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, whereas there is only Past and Present in Ages.
The bottom line is, I enjoyed this game very much, and would recommend it even to one who has never played a Zelda game before.

The sound is fantastic. I am able to hear heavy base along with notes at all spectrums. This fantastic sound has really made my gaming and video streaming experience that much better. It is like hearing a surround sound system inside of my head. It is truly fantastic. There is even a toggle volume on the back of the left ear cup that allows me to easily control the volume up or down when I need to.

The cord is thick and quite durable. The braided material on the outside of the cord really gives it that extra strength. The cord is 7 ft long which really allows me plenty of room to comfortably move around while it's plugged in.

The microphone works well too. I've spoken to friends online while gaming and all of them state that I come through clearly without any distortion or feedback.

5.0,False,"01 23, 2012",A27OW0P38B28OP,B004WLRQMI,Relytia,"With the benefit of retrospection, it's easy to assume that this game may very well be the last of a pure type of Zelda breed.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skyward-Sword/dp/B002BSC54I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skyward Sword</a>&nbsp;has come and gone, and has seemingly ushered in a new era of design ideas for future Zelda releases. That said, for those who believe that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocarina-of-Time/dp/B003O6E800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocarina of Time</a>&nbsp;is among the greatest games of all time, this is a game for you. For just as Ocarina of Time introduced an amazing template for a ""classical"" 3D Zelda experience, Twilight Princess took that template design and sharpened it to an unimaginable gleam. This is an incredible game, even today still, and now that it is a ""Nintendo Select,"" there's no better time to get into it.

The story in Twilight Princess really hearkens back to a classic Nintendo theme of duality. Much like the dual-timelines of Ocarina of Time, or the Light/Dark World of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Link-to-the-Past/dp/B00002STXN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Link to the Past</a>, there are two dimensions at play here. Link is a young man living in the peaceful, forested Ordon providence near Hyrule, in a small village. Here he lives a peaceful life with his fellow villagers, making a living on the famous Ordon Goat Ranch. Meanwhile, the light soaked kingdom of Hyrule has been invaded by beings from another dimension called the Twilight realm, their king a creepy villain named Zant. Zant's plan is to combine his world of Shadow with Hyrule, creating a dark, twisted reality for him to control. One day, Link's life is interrupted by this chaos, and once again, a young man clad in green will take up the call of destiny and stave back the sinister darkness that has fallen over Hyrule. He will also meet a shadow imp named Midna, who seems to be untrustworthy at first, but will come to be an awesome companion throughout the quest.

It is immediately discernable while playing this game that this is a darker Zelda game than has ever come before it, with perhaps&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Majora-s-Mask/dp/B000JVM256/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Majora's Mask</a>&nbsp;being the exception. Indeed, this is a gritty story, full of dark moments and even some more violent parts for a Zelda game (but still admittedly tame by industry standards these days). As with any Zelda title, you can count on the characters being likable, compelling, and charming. The writing of all characters, minor and major, is very well done, as is their design. Midna is worth mention alone. My all-time favorite companion character in a Zelda game (We even named our puppy after her :D), not only is she helpful, but her back-story is deep and her character is so well conceived and executed, she's an absolute delight to have along on the journey. She's a real stand-out in the entire franchise and that's saying a lot! What helps make the experience so compelling is also the cinematic nature of the game. Though not quite as dynamically cinematic as newer Zelda offerings, Twilight Princess still boasts some really interesting cutscenes and story events. Yes, Twilight Princess is a great game in regards to its story and presentation.

The art/sound design in this game is also very well done. After their grand cel shading adventure in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wind-Waker/dp/B002I0GF72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wind Waker</a>, Nintendo took Twilight Princess to the extreme polar opposite, opting for a more ""realistic"" graphic novel-like approach for the visuals. Granted, this is a Gamecube game, albeit a gorgeous one, ported over to Wii, so don't expect HD console graphics, but even having just beat this game for the fourth time last week, the graphics in this game are still beautiful. Link looks awesome, and to see many familiar elements of the series realized in this unique, realistic fashion is awesome. The visual splendor of the Twilight Realm alone is worthy of mention. This bloom lit world is filled with really beautiful particle effects and coloring, and is a real joy to behold. Imagine the way a sunset bathes the world in a warm, piercing light that makes everything look radiant, and that's what the Twilight Realm looks like here. Very cool. The music is very well done too, as you probably already expected. Koji Kondo once again delivered. The music here ranges from haunting, creepy, atmospheric, lovely, moving, majestic, powerful, and everything in between. The only thing I wish they had done different with the music was to have some of it fully orchestrated, as the gorgeous compositions would have really benefited by it, but that is a minor gripe that only serves to further compliment the brilliance of the music itself. It really is a beautiful soundtrack.

The gameplay is where this game takes Ocarina's template, and expands upon it to new heights. Seriously, imagine&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocarina-of-Time/dp/B00000DMB3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocarina of Time</a>, and then grow its scope and size several times. You'll be going on an epic quest across a ginormous Hyrule, exploring its massive field, its various regions, its several provinces, villages, and towns, as well as discovering its clever temples and dungeons. There's a big emphasis here on horseback riding and combat. Some story events require it. The world here is really big, it would take forever to try and run across it all on foot. This huge space is utilized very well, hiding a ton of collectibles and secrets that true fans of the exploratory aspect of the Zelda series will love. The traditional Zelda gameplay is true perfection of the adventure game genre. The controls are fantastic, the puzzles and combat are incredibly satisfying, and, as you'd expect, the temples and their special items are a real highlight. It all comes together in a way that really pays homage to Ocarina of Time, every step of the way, even while expanding the scope to previously unseen levels. Other aspects of the traditional play has been expanded on as well. Link has many new moves that really makes him feel like a true warrior swordsman. Despite the fact swings are pre-rendered and merely activate with a waggle of the wii-mote, fighting in the game feels quite satisfying.

Like I said earlier, there is a dual nature to the adventure here, and that expands beyond the story and into the gameplay aspects as well. You see, when Link encounters the Twilight Realm in Hyrule, because of his blessing by the goddesses as a true hero, he transforms into a fierce wolf instead of a mere wandering, lost spiritual flame like everyone else. This changes the nature of the gameplay quite a bit. Now you will use his sharpened senses to track scents, his teeth instead of his sword, his paws to dig in almost any spot, etc. It's enough of a change from Link's traditional gameplay to really make it stand out. This, combined with the shadow realm's genuinely warm and beautiful aesthetics and equally unique musical queues and sound design help make this game's own mark on the franchise. Later on in the adventure, you have the option to switch between normal Link and his wolf form at will, and the game design takes full advantage of this, adding yet another interesting dimension to traversing the temples.

The Legend of Zelda is a spectacular series in video games, perhaps the greatest there is. Even with the benefit of over 25 years of retrospection, Twilight Princess is a very unique game that stands out. If considered in context of Zelda's history as a whole, it is perhaps the most comprehensive, encyclopedic ""classical"" experience you could expect from the series, while also feeling like one of the most unique at the same time. Those may seem like mutually exclusive statements, but somehow Twilight Princess pulls them both off quite effortlessly. Skyward Sword has finally released, and greatly reinvigorated the series with massively ground-breaking changes. If it heralds a new age for the Zelda series like many believe, then Twilight Princess is the ultimate ""classical"" Zelda experience and a true relic of a fantastic era, and may well be for quite a while. If so, it is an excellent title that will no doubt continue to satisfy any gamer's desire for even more years to come. Now that it is a Nintendo Select title, there's no better time like the present. Buy it, adventure through the massive kingdom of Hyrule, and once again take up the mantle of chosen Hero and save the world of light.","The most refined and expansive ""classical"" 3D Zelda experience to date",1327276800,42,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This game cannot be played by idiots.  It forces the player to use his or her intellect in order to think out the best strategy possible for their character.  It is fully interactive in real time, and the other people you find in the game are actually other real time players like yourself!  By this token, however, the game experience is a very dynamic one and may be considered a kid's game one minute and an adults the next due to some players' language (some players are very fond of using the ""f"" word for example).  However, there are language filters so a concerned parent can edit that stuff out.
What we have here is one of the most involving and creative things yet produced for the internet.  It is much like Everquest, only it has superior polish, story, features and presentation.  This is Final Fantasy taken to a whole new level and, being a long time fan of the series, I was blown away with how different this installment is.  Change is a good thing, my friends.
This is entertainment that, unlike television, is NOT PASSIVE.  You do not sit there and watch this brainlessly.  You must constantly be interacting, speaking with, and trading goods with your fellow players.  Which brings me to the battles.  Ah, the battles!  It is epic.  I am truly impressed.  You pick your favorite job from all the old jobs offered in the series (example : Dragoon, Paladin, Bard, Red Mage, Monk etc.) and tailor this job to a specific race which you find fits your style.  This is very dynamic and complex, and as such makes just about every group you join completely unique and different.  You must utilize your unique job skill in a group full of other online players like yourself.  It is awesome.
This game has become the refuge for intelligent, imaginative people worldwide.  In many ways, this has become my full time replacement for the mire and muck of American television.

5.0,False,"08 9, 2010",A3TNX9B4JOTE7I,B001ASJIRM,Bryan,"I usually don't write reviews, but I think this game is underrated, and think Halo is overrated. I want lots of people to buy this game so there will be more people playing online. I'm sort of disappointed with Xbox live for all my games, because there's not as many people playing as I thought. The single player mode is fun and easy but it gets boring after awhile, I didn't finish, the multi-player mode is too addicting. Every time I play online, I pretty much play on a new map, how great is that? It's new and so I don't get tired of the game. This is because there is a map making mode that is a 100000x better than Halo's forge. There are maps that look like junk-yards, deserts, beaches, cities, jungles, and other stuff. People even make crazy interesting maps that change the game play like in one you're trapped in a building and you must snipe to fight. There are different game modes online as well. There is a turf war thing called uprising where winner controls 3 posts, there is a capture the flag mode, and of course there is a death-match and team death match mode. You can rate all the maps too so to fitter out the just ok ones. The bad thing is you can't really pick your character, but this isn't a big problem. You pick the weapon and a different guy will hold it, for example the basic sniper is always a dude with a cowboy hat (but at least 3 different guys wearing it). You can change weapons everything you die. You get new weapons when you buy them during the game. You can figure it out when you play, but the main thing is that you can progress your weapons while you the play the same match and map. So read other reviews for single player mode, but really you should buy this game just for the cool multi-player mode. Unlike Halo the maps have good places to snipe and hide, you can actually go inside buildings too. The graphics in this game are the best I've seen yet, but really video games need to catch up with movies. Like all games, the scenery is good, but unlike most games I've played the people in this game look more real, their skin looks rounded, smooth, and shinny, and the blood and fire look great as well.","Great game, one of my new favs, muti-player, xbox live",1281312000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"06 21, 2014",AT033BUEYOOKV,B000F6H57K,Nathan.E,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist has a lot to live up to. With both the amazing arcade game and SNES port, Turtles in Time, Hyperstone Heist has big shoes to fill. Thankfully, Konami didn't go for a direct port here, as they knew the Genesis lacked the sprite scaling and Mode 7 capabilities for the port to be faithful. Instead, we get a new, original game in the Turtles beat 'em up series, and it's easily one of the best, even managing to surpass awesome games like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game and The Manhattan Project.

It may sound like blasphemy, but I also believe The Hyperstone Heist manages to be a superior gaming experience to Turtles in Time, in some areas. The difficulty of the game is heightened, and we're left with a more rewarding, more challenging experience. While the color palette of the Genesis is technically inferior to the SNES, you really wouldn't know it by playing this. Colors appear much brighter and more contrasted than the already wonderful looking SNES arcade port, and overall, I prefer the visual style used here. It's not about how many colors you have at your disposal. It's what you do with them, and Hyperstone Heist is a great example of this sentiment.

Like I mentioned, the gameplay here feels a bit more challenging. Enemies seem more ready to fight than they did in either the Arcade or SNES games. They simply do a lot less standing around, and a lot more fighting, particularly if you're playing on hard mode. It also seems the differences in the Turtles themselves were tweaked, allowing for a more balanced experience. It could just be the Genesis itself being responsible for the game feeling this way, but the gameplay as a whole feels much faster-paced here than it does in Turtles in Time. Especially if you're playing as Raphael, the fastest character in the game. It simply runs smoother, with no slowdown anywhere to be seen.

There aren't as many levels here as there are in Turtles in Time, but thankfully, Konami opted to include longer levels to balance this out. The levels play out of amalgamations of levels found in the classic '89 arcade game as well as Turtles in Time. They're intelligently designed, with the game's pace in mind at all times, and nothing ever overstays its welcome despite these levels being longer in comparison to the SNES game. It's a shame we don't get the awesome Mode 7 levels, and I miss being able to throw enemies into the screen. Hyperstone Heist certainly isn't as much of a special effects powerhouse as Turtles in Time is, but I believe it's the smoother playing and better balanced game of the two.

The boss fights are also more challenging than those found in Turtles in Time, with most characters using patterns that are similar to the '89 arcade game. This is welcome, as after playing both Hyperstone Heist and Turtles in Time for years now, Hyperstone is the game I keep coming back to. The difficulty presented just hits a sweet spot. Not too easy, not too hard. That's not to say that once you manage to play this game to the best of your abilities you won't be able to play through it without losing just a few lives, because you absolutely can. Even on hard mode. It's not what I would call a ""hard"" game, by any means, but it's definitely more challenging than the game it draws inspiration from, and it trades off the dynamic level diversity for dynamic enemy and boss encounters.

The music here is also outstanding. Much like the rest of the game, the music here runs faster than what we hear in the arcade game or the SNES version, and lacks any and all of the distorted, tinny sound the Genesis is known for. The melodies come through clear, the bass sounds full, the treble sounds bright, and there's some great stereo separation throughout. It sounds wonderful. The voice samples don't fare as well, however. In comparison to the SNES game, there aren't as many of them, and the ones that are here don't sound as clear. I can't stress enough how awesome of a soundtrack this game has, though, and I vastly prefer it over the reverb-y, compressed sound of the SNES game.

All in all, Hyperstone Heist is an awesome game, and easily my favorite beat 'em up on the Genesis. The animations are slick and smooth, the music is outstanding, and the game as whole runs peppier than its arcade or SNES counterparts. It manages to differentiate itself enough from both, and as a standalone title, it has a lot going for it. As a more challenging experience that runs smoother, with longer levels and boss fights that rely on patterns more than they do mashing a button to win, The Hyperstone Heist is an incredible game that deserves so much more than to be written off as a Turtles in Time knock-off. Both are amazing games, and Turtles fans shouldn't pass up on either one.",The best beat 'em up on Genesis,1403308800,,,

5.0,True,"04 7, 2016",A3OCFALPMKSDA,B00ZS15FVA,Socrates the Philosopher,"Awesome game! The graphics in gameplay are obviously a huge step down from what I was used to on the Wii U version, but I never expect anything incredible on the 3DS in terms of graphics. The cutscenes still look pretty. However, I don't use 3D often, so I have no opinion on how that looks in this game.

If you've played the Wii U version, Legends is very similar. They have made good use of the 3DS's dual screen by showing the map on the touchscreen while you're battling. The story line is mostly the same, with the new characters' battles and storylines added in. Since the game doesn't have multiplayer capabilities, they've made some adjustments so you can switch between characters by touching their face on the touchscreen. You can also send characters around the map by touching the map. That's proven to be very helpful so I can fight with one character while the other characters run across the giant fields to get in position for the next mission. Having two or more playable characters next to each other while fighting a big boss makes the big boss weaker and the players stronger. They have added new missions to each battle to mix things up a bit and added owl statues in some stages so you can play the ocarina and teleport to different areas of the map. If you played the first game, I'm sure you'll realize what a benefit that can be.

Linkle is my favorite of the added characters. She's fast and her attacks can take out a bunch of enemies at once. Toon Link and Tetra are fun as well. I love that Toon Link's special attack is the hurricane spin from Windwaker. He even gets dizzy for a second afterward.

This game also included an insert with a code to unlock the new characters from Legends on the Wii U version of the game, which made me happy. I wish they would have made a way to transfer the levels on my Wii U characters to my 3DS characters, since I spent so many hours leveling them up on the Wii U.",Solid Game for the 3DS,1459987200,4,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo 3DS'}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31ecHDz7GJL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/411763FeaFL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41AAYBjIs0L._SY88.jpg']"

When I got it and started playing it, at first I was like ""wth is this kiddy shi...stuff and long annoying cut scenes""... and went in playing with a ""oh well... im stuck with it till monday"" mood. Several more mins into the game it made me chuckle... but still not convinced (since I saw the mediocre ratings it was getting, compared to every other game available at the time)... So I just shaked my head, and was like... ""stupid...lol""..... Yea, you know where this is going....  Half hour into the game, I am laughing my a$* off, uncontrollably with every cut scene, that I couldn't stop playing, just to see what they would come up with next... Yea, this once ""too cool for silly cartoons"" 18 year old ""man"" was giggling like a school girl an hour in, and was seriously wondering why this game wasn't up there with the rest of the xbox exclusives.. I kept this game so long that eventually gamefly just shipped out the next game in my queue, thinking that it probobly got lost in the mail or something.... Im not gonna lie, I kept it, and didn't say a word, since they deleted it from the queue too and still played it regularly.... I knew the rules, but I was honestly still hooked with it, that I wasn't ready to send it back, but also didn't have the money to buy it at full price back then..... kids of today are lucky to have places like amazon where all games drop in value fairly quickly... If there were deals like today, I would of never done that.... Im 29 now, and of course feel bad, but at least I continued to support GF for many years.....Oh, and btw...Karma is real, folks!...  after a year or so that I completely stopped playing it, I made, and put it in a case and stored it next to all my others... over the years, my collection of games has grown to well over 300 xbox and xbox 360 titles, and just recently a youtuber that I follow asked us to list our top ten favorite xbox 360 exclusives, and sure enough it made #7 in my list and by doing that, it brought back memories, and got me excited to play it again... went looking for it, opened up the case and NOTHING!. went mad looking through every case to try and find it... NOTHING.. No worries, I'll just buy it on amazon... NOTHING here... so im like ""thats what I get! Guess I'll have to pay top dollar, and download it from xbox live""  again.. Nothing.... they're not selling it! :(  This game should be re released and remastered for xbox live arcade..... I felt like Rose from the movie titanic... ""come back!.... come back!""  .... The Hunt Begins!! Dun Dun Dun!! xD.","Overlooked, and Under appreciated gem that everyone must try",1415577600,,,

The combat, the controls, the graphics, the atmosphere, the voice acting, it's all fantastic. That being said, I didn't buy this game, I only rented it. I apologize to any Batman or DC comics fanboys/whining babies in advance, but this must be said... I'm not a really big fan of DC comics. It's not that I don't like Batman or DC, I just prefer Marvel comics much more than DC comics. If I were more into DC, Batman would definitely be one of my favorites. But since I already have a lot of games and don't like to buy every one that catches my interest, I chose to only buy Marvel games over DC games; the good ones only, not the lousy ones like Iron Man. Still, I have to admit, Batman: Arkham Asylum is better than pretty much any of the Spider-Man games I have, even Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man: Web of Shadows. This game follows everyone's favorite Caped Crusader as he delivers the Joker to the titular loony bin once again and places him into the custody of the guards, only for the wily wacko to escape from his guards and then wrest control of the entire island by taking the asylum's employees hostage and threatening to detonate several bombs in Gotham City should anyone try to come into the asylum. Joker and his foolish follower Harley Quinn are able to watch Batman through the many cameras and viewscreens throughout the asylum and mock him with their rather amusing jokes and one-liners that they're known for.

It's going to be a long night for the Dark Knight (yes, it rhymes). However, he will have some help from Oracle (the alias Batgirl used when confined to a wheelchair) who can communicate with Batman and use her helpful researching skills to assist Batman in his battle against the Joker. Batman will have to explore pretty much the entire asylum and the surrounding area of the island to track down the Joker and stop his crazy plot (which I won't spoil). To do this, Batman will have to make great use of his wits and many gadgets to locate clues that will help him figure out how to stop the Joker, as well as track down certain hostages and allies so Joker doesn't have them killed. Bats will of course also have to beat up many thugs and psychos that Joker has released from their cells to use them as his own army of henchmen. Some of the gadgets the Dark Knight will use include: batarangs that can stun enemies and give Batman an opening to attack, the grappling gun that allows Batman to reach higher ledges or save himself from a deadly fall, explosive foam that can be used to blast down certain walls and barriers, and other gadgets that you acquire later in the game.

Batman's detective mode, which is built into his mask, gives him x-ray vision which highlights important items and substances that can be followed as clues. It also lets him see where hostages and enemies are, as well as their state of mind (calm, scared, panicking) and if enemies are armed. Speaking of enemies, you'll normally encounter them in one of two types of instances: stealth (predator) sessions or straight-up combat sessions. During the stealth sessions, Batman will be required to take out a number of thugs armed with guns in order to save hostages or simply to advance to the next area. The guys who built Arkham Asylum had a strange preference for gargoyle statues and placed several of them near the ceilings of most areas in the asylum; this is good for Batman, since he can use them to stay above his prey and then take them out before being spotted by other enemies. He can either use his cape to glide down to his enemies and kick them in the face as he lands or wait for them to pass underneath him as he's perched on a gargoyle, lowering himself over them and plucking them up in his cape to knock them out, leaving them hanging from the gargoyle by their feet. Taking out one enemy and letting his friends find him unconscious puts them on edge and it can be rather satisfying hearing the thugs panic and breathe heavily in fear of the one who hunts them (sometimes they'll even shoot wildly around themselves in the hopes of landing a hit on Batman). Beware, because you won't always be able to rely on the gargoyle statues in some of the later stealth sessions. Fortunately, Batman can use other methods to sneak up on his enemies, such as crawling through air vents or crawl spaces underneath the floors and pounce on them when they get close. If spotted, Batman should either shoot up to the nearest gargoyle statue and out of sight, or run away to the nearest vent or crawl space since the enemies with guns can kill Batman in seconds.

In combat sessions, Batman can make use of his superb fighting skills, batarangs, and some later weaponry to take out many enemies with style and flair. He'll mostly fight regular thugs, psychos armed with knives, thugs with shock batons, and animalistic psychos who simply jump on the hero and tear at him like feral cats (you'll even see these guys eating rats on certain occasions... yummy). Using a similar control layout to Spider-Man 2, the four face buttons let Batman use several different fighting moves. One lets him attack, one lets him stun enemies with a swing of his cape, one lets him block/counter his enemies, and one lets him run/dodge roll. Because of this simple and accessible layout of controls, the combat ends up being one of the best things about this game, if not the best thing. Picking up a good rhythm when fighting enemies is key to keeping Batman's health up (kind of like Devil May Cry), since large numbers of tougher thugs can be a challenge for Bats if he gets cornered, especially if they use makeshift weapons like nearby cinderblocks or pipes that they pull off the walls. Plus, the longer you keep up an uninterrupted combo using either of the four main forms of attack, as well as batarangs and so on, the more damage Batman's attacks will do after each successful hit, and you'll earn more experience points. These points can be used to upgrade Batman's gear: throwing several batarangs at once, tougher body armor to increase durability, learn special grappling and throwing moves, etc. The graphics to this game are among the best I've seen in a video game. The characters and environments all look fantastic and detailed. One thing the game could have used a bit more of was more challenging and varied boss fights. More than once, Batman will fight these thugs who have been beefed up like Bane; sometimes there will be two of them and they'll be backed up by regular thugs.

Batman will also fight Bane, Poison Ivy in a large mutated plant, and an endboss who doesn't really bring anything new to the table. The boss fights were fun, but could have had more to them. However, Batman does face off against other villains in different ways. He encounters Scarecrow in a few nightmare-like scenarios when he gets affected by his annoying fear toxin, which are fun and interesting (one tries to trick you into believing you've got a game over, like a couple of the Metal Gear Solid games have done). He also has a rather pulse pounding encounter with Killer Croc, but you don't directly fight him; it would have been cool if you could fight him afterwards, but sadly you don't. There are also many hidden Riddler clues, entertaining recordings of therapy sessions involving Batman's rogues gallery, and other secrets for avid collectible hunters to find, even after you've completed the game. Technically, this game is a free-roaming sandbox game, but not as large scaled or in the same style as the Spider-Man games or Infamous; aside from collecting the hidden secrets I just mentioned, there are actually few moments where you'll have to revisit an area for a mission. What will keep most players busy after the game are the challenge maps, where you play as Batman (or Joker after downloading him) in increasingly difficult stealth and combat sessions... those are fun. Finally, I'll end with a quick praise of the voice acting, specifically Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, who voiced Joker and Batman respectively in the game as well as the DC animated series and movies. They will always be the true voices of those characters. You all know the silly reason why I didn't buy this game, but that shouldn't stop the rest of you from buying it.

I don't review a lot of games but I can already tell this one warrants a review. I'm only halfway through, but this game rocks. If you are seeking a Destiny-derivative, multiplayer-munching, Call of Duty doping, trigger-happy, clone --- then turn away from the screen because this one isn't for you. It's actually refreshing and exciting to play.

It feels both unique and familiar at the same time. It reminds me of my first encounters with many N64 games--like the gameplay just feels right, right off the bat. And there isn't a 25 minute hand-holding tutorial of interactive cutscenes to start off the ""action"". I'm not going to breakdown every single element or go into the story.... I will address some of the negatives that people have complained about.

First and foremost: the long loading times. Honestly, I haven't even noticed them being long. Maybe it's only certain copies or consoles? I have even counted. Between missions or fast-travel, the game loads in 15 seconds or less. These instances are few and far between so I'm not sure why everyone is complaining so much. Secondly, lack of storyline. The storyline is actually pretty good for what it is. It's no Mass Effect or the Last of Us, but a large part of the story is the world that we get to explore and the characters. Fourth: poor graphics? Really? The graphics are fine. They look great and they don't affect the gameplay so stop whining people. It's not all about graphics. Look at some of these photorealistic beautiful games that take 7 years to make and play like crap. No thank you. I'll take story and gameplay over that any day. Lastly, backtracking and revisiting areas: a lot of games are steering away from this, I guess but I don't really have a problem with it. It takes a lot of cues from games like DK64, Banjo 64 or Mario 64 where you need to collect cores to proceed and unlock doors. Which is a good thing to me.

I read some negative reviews on this game so I was on the fence, but the platforming elements and world looked fantastic, so I bought it anyways. For $32 with Amazon Prime, how could I not? I am so glad I did. I have been so bored with the latest batch of ""next-gen"" games. Every game is the same thing. Locate point on you rminimap, retrieve item, fight bad guy. Travel, traverse, fetch quest, power up, rinse repeat. I understand to a point that every game breaks down this way, but I think you know what I'm referring to. This generation has just been a slew of boring sandbox quests and repetive, shallow shooting with very few games peaking my interest or doing anything truly fun or creative. ReCore is a refreshing change of course, and I'm very glad the developers or publishers didn't seem to catch on to the fact that they have a game on their hands worth $60. It seems they've undervalued their own creation, which is sad.

All in all I rate this game an 8.8 out of 10. Since there are so many haters tipping the scale unjustly, and I can't rank that precisely, I'll round to 5 out of 5. Haha",If Jak 3 and Metroid Prime had a Banjo Baby!,1474243200,11,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

The gameplay is a little difficult, on account of being complex. But the game's opening gives one the ability to familiarize oneself with combat for as long as one likes before moving on, and I advise doing so - besides the practicality of it, the weapons availible from the start are gleefully powerful and fun to use. Later on in the game one is given mind powers to use, and one will need to rely on these in several parts of the game. These powers are exciting and beautifully rendered, as well as original.

Gameplay is pushed beyond the normal limits of play/video alternation, with many situations where events that would normally be conveyed via a clip instead integrated into the gameplay - calling for more reflexes and making things that much more immersive.

The game does have its technical faults, as many have said. These amounted for me to a bit of lag in several places, abnormalities in the sound delivery (this is the main fault - some noises are skipped, some are delivered at reduced volume, some were even too loud. None of these were particularly annoying, though, and only happen when there is a large workload on the system, such as during large firefights), and a few freezes, but these only near the beginning of the game. Given the graphical quality, however, none of this was surprising. Rather, I'm surprised they could go this far with the Xbox, and I suspect that future installments will be made for the 360 instead.

As for the story, it deserves all the praise it's gotten, for it is entertaining and polished enough, as one would expect with the screenplay written by Orson Scott Card. For the record, I admire the decision to give story that much attention, and feel that this is the direction which games need to continue to go, as they are replacing television as the dominant form of entertainment. The story is also strangely compelling, for myself at least, in the way it protrays human beings - contrasted against alien races, revered as the originators by these peoples (contrary to the popular new-age belief that alien races ""planted"" us here!), and given extraordinary power. I'm not quite sure of the how and why of this themery yet, and suspect that it will be dealt with more in future. But, in the face of ruthless destruction, mankind has found the ability to fight back with unelievable power, and the character which we play is the catalyst to it all. At the same time there is a sense of loss, of no going backwards. Sound worth your while? I think so, I just think so.",Brilliantly Original,1145232000,,,

In terms of mechanics, Barbarian Invasions isn't that different from Rome, except for the need to manage religious affiliations and the difficulty of increasing leaders' Command ability through battle successes.  It is different in the historical context as we move from an up-and-coming Rome to a dying empire.  I think that neither period are what we best ""know"" Rome for, which would probably be early Empire, circa Caesar or Augustus (50 BC - 100 AD).

The Total War series is almost unique in combining deep turn based strategic and economic management with real time tactical battles.  Each aspect complements the other quite well, though the battle engine is the true jewel.  The tactics, terrain, units and the rendering are just amazing.  I generally find the strategic level more challenging throughout, because tactical battles become easier and easier as you upgrade your troops and they gain experience.  Once you know your way around the solo campaign game, you can stretch out your investment by switching factions, playing historical battles (warning:  only 2 of those in BI!) or play online.

My only criticism, at the strategic level, is Rome's unrest bias against large urban populations (inherited from Civ?), combined with the attractiveness of systematically exterminating cities to fill your coffers.  My favorite strategy in Rome involves pulling troops out of a rioting city, making it easier for the city to revolt, then besiege and exterminate it.  Which results in me collecting lots and lots of gold during the sack.  Afterwards, depopulated cities are very loyal and have huge cashflows.  That's an odd way to manage economies and feels morally repugnant as well.  But it works :-)

The ""harmless"" corpse dropping from the ceiling or the sudden crackings, be it the sprinklers turning on or potential enemies on the other side of the wall that you may or may not need to deal with, made even me jump sometimes. The blood stains and the violet light in the Medical deck of USG Ishimura could be potentially combined with some more supernatural occurrences but are very good on their own already.

In my opinion, the first half of the game is more horror-oriented, as you often find yourself in (complete) darkness, have relatively few variations in your arsenals, and especially for people like me who didn't play Dead Space 1, you get to know all kinds of grotesque necromorphs. Darkness and uncertainty really are the core of horror, personally I find that the Resident Evil series has lost its horror charm ever since when fighting zombies/undead takes place under day light. The second half (I would say after the solar array) is more action-packed, as you are now familiar with different weapons and enemies, and lighting is much better, but when you do face enemies they are much tougher.

I recommend playing this game on survivalist difficulty on the first playthrough. After all, if you don't die frequently and aren't constantly in shortage of ammos you are not playing a survival horror. The ""reward"" of dying is that you get to see all the death scenes, something I do quite frequently in later chapters, but hey, when you die you learn something so next time you can set up some mines or switch to better weapons to overcome the onslaught. Also, remember that this is a survival game, your primary goal is to survive, not to annihilate the enemies, so if some battles are simply too tough, see if you avoid it or slip to the next section.

I urge you NOT to read any guides or walkthroughs beforehand. I mean, what's the point of a survival horror game if you know already that certain corridors are safe except for the shrieking and growling in the background? I only read the walkthrough of the chapters I have completed to see what I have missed or so. And don't bother reading the IGN guide. It comes across as written by a twelve-year-old playing on easy difficulty. The guide with pictures is more difficult to follow than plain text, and certain strategies are just wrong (e.g. Chapter 13 in the room with three levels where you need to fight a brute at the bottom level, IGN guides recommends to stasis and ""move past the rooms quickly"", so that once you reach the second or bottom level all the necromorphs you previously skipped can all be funneled to you? I suggest staying near the door right past the save station and take advantage of the door and take out as many enemies as you can so it will be much easier to fight once you proceed to the second or bottom level.) Also, every weapon in the game has a purpose. Again I disagree with IGN saying that Seeker Rifle is useless. I bought this gun at the beginning of Chapter 13 and never regretted. In later stages when you need to take down enemies FAST, the Seeker Rifle is much better than the beloved but power-lacking plasma cutter.

Some minor flaws include:
- Anti-aliasing doesn't work well, but otherwise the graphic is good.
- The second half of the game lacks a little in story, especially since (as mentioned above) the horror charm starts to fade away. Fighting enemies also get a little predictable and repetitive, e.g. an enhanced slasher ambushing you from the front is usually accompanied by an enhanced puker attacking you from the back, but learning these patterns will make the fight easier.
- Personally I don't plan to play it a second time, at least not in the near future, 'cause I just can't play it as a survival horror anymore now that I've completed the game and known all the surprises. Would still be a solid shooter/action game though.",An epic combination of horror and action,1328400000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",
5.0,True,"12 21, 2011",A1OZ0PGAE70JQI,B001CWXAP2,Griswel,"Look, this is an MMORPG, so how the game will play years from now or even six months is up in the air.  However, I have to say, so far so good.

First, accept that this is in many ways World of Warcraft set in Star Wars land.  WoW borrowed from other MMORPGs which borrowed from still others and so on, until players got a basic framework that did what needed to be done.  SWG tried something completely different, and suffered for it.  This is not to say that all WoW classes have one-for-one substitutes in SWTOR, far from it.  The Old Republic works far more with hybrid class structure.  Crowd control, for example, tends to be spread across classes (though WoW does that, too).  But generally, healers heal, tanks tank, DPS DPSes and everyone has a health bar and some form of spendable energy.  Heck, tanks even build up rage.  So if you don't like classes and the basic format of other MMORPGs, SWTOR will disappoint.

If you like WoW, and eleventy billion people can't be wrong, and you like/love Star Wars, you'll love SWTOR.

If you want to be a Jedi, half the classes are Jedi, so enjoy!  Nothing says ""I'm cool"" like starting every fight firing up dual lightsabres and using Force Leap.  Gameplay in SWTOR looks an awful lot like the very cool cinematics the game starts with.

First off, the cinematics.  The opening cinematic for all players, and the ones for Sith/Republic are quite good.  But the game goes on in that vein, not with the same quality cinematics, but with cut-scenes and voice acting.  I've heard far from all there is, but it's all been somewhere between fine and outstanding.  If you're not in a hurry to kill the next mob, then it is very enjoyable.  Granted, there is a lot of ""rescue my son Joe"" or, if you're a Sith, ""brutally murder five innocent people in front of their families"", but there are only so many plots to go around.  Also, enough characters are either lunatics or lying to keep you on your toes.

There is a separate plot-line for each class.  The game offers even more replayability than most because of this.  The Classes on the two sides are better balanced than WoW or other MMORPGs, because they are identical!  Every Republic Class has an exact duplicate on the Sith side (or vice-versa) with a different name.  None of this ""they got X and we only got Y"" to complain about.  Well, there is one thing.  Sith have lightning shooting out of their hands.  Jedi get, um, very small rocks.  ""Suffer the wrath of my vaguely wind-like pebbles!""

Crafting seems to be well done, though I haven't gotten near the end game yet.  In a nice twist, crafting is done by ""companions"".  After a few levels, you get your first companion, then add more as you cap out.  One can come with you in most places.  Any of your companions can be sent off on various missions to acquire items or Darkside or Lightside points.  It even helps resource gathering - point your companion at the resource and run to the next objective or fight.  No more standing at a forge or equivalent.  Order your droid or other companion to ""make me more of this"" and voila, it pops into your inventory.  Very handy in a pinch.

There is virtually no built-in downtime.  Every class has an out-of-combat self-heal that means you're always five seconds from full.  Death is relatively painless, too, though the run back might not be quick.  Instances are typical MMORPG except there are very interesting stories with their own cut-scenes.  This is where the game will change dramatically as time goes on, of course.  They didn't ship with a fully fleshed-out endgame. PvP instances  are fun and instead of zones for levels 10-19, 20-29 and so on, there is a leveling function to generally equalize all combatants.

There are downsides.  At release, queues are a quite pain.  This is typical, though, and probably no worse for SWTOR than any other game which was popular at release.  Running is bad.  I don't mean not having a speeder, I mean that travel between places can be a real chore, especially on Coruscant (where city layouts can be maddening).  There are bind points in many places, and a half-hour cooldown lets you make frequent use of it, but travel might annoy you if your comparison is a one-player game (and not, say, EQ1) or simply in comparison with the player-friendliness of the rest of the design.  It also takes some time for your class to translate into the abilities you'll have later, and not just in raw power.  Healing, for example, can be frustrating into your twenties because you seem underpowered for the mobs you face.  As I said, classes tend to be hybrid, and it may be a while before a healer is intended to be heal-only, and not a shooter as well.  DPS, on the other hand, can DPS like a maniac from day one.

All in all, if you're considering a new MMORPG, this is the NEXT BIG THING, and - so far - it's been amazing.

Final Note - Kudos to Amazon for both their Release Date shipping policy, and for Overnighting both copies I had ordered (without any contact from me, so I believe it was done for everyone).  With the grace period/no grace period drama, it was nice to always know that Amazon would get the game to me on time.",Amazing ... So Far,1324425600,4,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Because of this I expected a very difficult game and to an extent this title is, however just to give a heads up one can argue that this game can be even more hard because in order to access the map you must go through your inventory.  I personally don't mind this since I like to remember where I went but some people might not like the fact that they have to pull their map up every time they get lost  Also, another thing to keep in mind is that the map you buy from the first shop keeper you find might not cover the area you are traversing in.

Just FYI, my favorite titles are:
--Mario Kart 8 (and make sure you get the DLC from the eshop -- it adds 16 new levels!)
--Legend of Zelda: WindWaker HD (the best version of the classic)
--Earthbound (~$10 to download via the eShop!)
--New Super Mario Bros. U (one of the best side-scrolling Mario games ever made)
--NES Remix(es)
--Super Mario 3D World (best multiplayer Mario I've ever played)
--Captain Toad (Bought this for my mom...and played it even more than she did, ha)

This is a highly addictive game.
Positive points:
+ Online playing is FREE unlike some other games.
+ You can control virtually any vehicles you encounter. You can even steal enemy stuff!
+ Multiplayer gaming is more fun because of the unpredictable behavior of real humans.
+ The rendering of terrain and objects is quite good. Even the trees sway in the breeze!
Negative points:
- Map loading is rather slow
- Spawning and respawning is slower than I'd expect
- There are still a few annoying bugs, but perhaps a patch is coming soon
Wish list:
? How about field artillary, Howitzers, cannons, etc.
? How about more initial spawn points closer to the action. Too much time spent getting there...

Williams,"This is one of my fav DS games, and has been in my console for at least the past month, I only changed it a couple days ago to try out my bejeweled Twist.  Basically you have 100 'boards' or 'layouts' in which you have to match 3 or more jewels horizontally or vertically in order to remove them (in removing them you build your 'stores' of gold, building materials and food which you then use to 'buy' your palace, idols etc and thus 'build' ancient Egypt).
You have various challenges in that you have to clear all the blue squares and then the scarab to complete the layout.  You have dark blue squares which only need to be used once ina jem match to clear, light blue need to be used twice, locked with single chain requires three matches and a double chain requires four, oh and did I mention that this is to time??  So yeah quite challenging, but you also have special 'tools' to assist - bomb (explodes single square), mega-bomb (explodes 9 squares), lightning (explodes 20 random squares), bottle (removes all of the items that you clicked on from the board) water (extra time) and a couple others.
I don't know how many times I have replayed this game over, I still find certain layouts require a couple attempts to complete.

I installed RTCW, which was a snap, and proceeded to play night and day for 3 full days until I beat this fantastic game. It was an experience, which is something that you will understand if you're a true gamer. If you're a new gamer, this game has the potential to give you your first true experience. I'm talking about games like Halflife, No One Lives Forever, or Deus Ex that you don't want to end. I didn't want RTCW to end. The graphics are phenomenal- that is, the landscapes and charcter design are of the highest order. The Quake 3 engine that everyone is talking about is truly worthy of its acclaim. Everything has texture, the enemy AI is realistic, and the in-game dialogue is believable. However, the graphics and gameplay aren't what make this game truly amazing. The story is what RTCW will be forever remembered for. You get to fight Nazis,(always a plus in gaming), but also uncover the secrets of the Third Reich's Paranormal Division. Needless to say, you're in for some creepy confrontations. This element of science fiction mixed with true WWII action is what I loved most about the game.

In my opinion, compare with rebirth2 and rebirth3, rebirth1 has the best gameplay experience because of its difficulty. The group decided to make rebirth2 and rebirth3 easier after they received some feedbacks. To me, its pretty sad that they made rebirth2 and rebirth3 so easy, oh I almost forgot, they also made a patch that made rebirth1 a little bit easier than 1.0 version. I am a hardcore player, I know this is not a hardcore game, but I still want some challenges. Though the patch will make rebirth1 easier,  I still recommand you update the game because 1.0 version has really poor frame rate, they fixed this problem in later versions.
Now lets talk about the story. The stories of this series are quite unique, based on the history of gaming industries. If you are not  familiar with last century game events or features, you may miss a lot of fun. And this series has a few dirty jokes, not too much though. So Neptunia games are not for kids though all the characters have cute appearances. Personally, I prefer the story of rebirth3, it has more anime feel, more funny and happy events, even enemies are funny. Watching them made me feel younger(ok, im not that old, i just wanna say feel like back to last century). The stories of rebirth1 and rebirth2 are also funny, but not as funny as rebirth3.
Personally, Neptunia(Neptune) is my favourite character. Compare with other characters, she is childish and always make other people feel embrassing. The story would be quite boring without her. When she transfer into purple heart, oh my god, she becomes extremly charming.
Voices are amazing, all the dubbing actress are famous in Japan, they really did a good job.
Musics are very good, if you do have some knowledge about music, you can easily find how well the musics in this game are, always fit the scenes perfectly and well arranged.
This series is definately one of the best series on vita system. Although it s not an epic, all you can get from this series is happy! This series is not for kids, kids who never experienced last century games cannot understand the stories and all the jokes well. If you just heard about this series

5.0,False,"06 9, 2003",ABRKIJ6D4V42O,B00004TSXC,Amazon Customer,"It would be fairer to compare this story to the original Baldur's Gate, instead of the sequel Baldur's Gate 2. The storyline to NWN is not as strong as Baldur's Gate, as your own character is another ""nameless adventurer"", and therefore has very little personal stake in the story's events. It's best to think of the single-player campaign as a showcase for the Bioware developers, to show what the game-engine is capable of doing.
The graphics engine is much more advanced than the Infinity Engine used in Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. Everything is portrayed in a 3D-environment. This is especially evident in the flame effects from objects as mundane as torches, to the flames emanating from an approaching demon. Spell effects are spectacular - the best being area effect spells. Even spells as mundane as ""Hold Undead"" display a mighty impressive light show.
The interface is also much less cluttered than the older Bioware games. Some of the commands come from a radial interface, which can be activated by right-clicking the mouse. The rest (eg. Journal, Inventory, Spellbook) come from a small menu on the right-hand side of the screen. The other 90% of the screen is clear, which makes it possible to watch the rest of the action without being distracted.
It is possible to switch between different camera view modes from within the game menu. You can also zoom in and out using the mousewheel (if your mouse has one). This feature is particularly useful when fighting foes, and you want to examine the battle up close.
One of the most glaring differences between NWN and Baldur's Gate, is the lack of multiple characters in your party. In Baldur's Gate 2, there was space for up to five extra characters. This made for some interesting moments, especially if some of your characters had different alignments. I think the reason for this may have been the difficulty of implementing this ""multiple-character"" feature in the Aurora toolset, and making it user-friendly enough for the casual mod-creator. Hopefully, NWN will implement this feature in a sequel to NWN.
I would strongly recommend this game to newcomers to the RPG genre of PC gaming. NWN's interpretation of the 3rd Edition rules is incredibly easy to master, as so many of the mechanics (eg saving throws, attacks of opportunity) are calculated behind the scenes without any intervention from the player. A new player can quite literally hack and slash their way through this game ala' Diablo, if they chose to. However, for experienced players of D&D there is enough depth in the single-player game to keep them amused for a few hours.
However, Neverwinter Night's greatest strength has only become self-evident over the few years since it's release - and this it's customisable tools. The Aurora toolset gives users the power to create their own adventures and distribute them to other players on the internet. I strongly recommmend Penultima series (created by Stefan ""Twoflower"" Gagne's) as a terrific jump-off point. Penultima can best be thought of as a send-up of the RPG games that Bioware are famous for. Every single convention of RPG-gaming is skewered mercilessly. It's very much inspired by the Discworld-series of Terry Pratchett novels, and is well worth the download. And Penultima is only the tip of the iceberg. There are countless other examples on the internet, of adventures that have been created by devoted fans of NWN. In some cases, like Penultima, the originality and flair of the storylines outshine the original campaign created by Bioware.
Please note, that a tutorial and detailed documentation on the Aurora toolset, is available for free download on the Bioware website. There is no need to purchase the strategy guide. In addition, the NWN internet community has posted many articles and tutorials on the Aurora toolset.
When NWN was first released, many players were complaining of the ""lack of content"" in the game. They felt that there wasn't enough depth to the single-player campaign to warrant its purchase. It's now obvious that Bioware were taking a huge gamble, hoping that whatever ""depth"" was lacking in the campaign, would be more than compensated for by the huge numbers of fan-created modules that would follow. In the end, it paid off, as any visit to Bioware's NWN website would so effectively attest to. NWN has a thriving internet community, and in the end, it is this that makes the game such a worthwhile purchase.
One final note, for those with older PC's. The game is best viewed and played on a relatively fast PC. This game was reviewed on an AMD Athlon 2000+ XP with 512MB RAM and GEForce 4 videocard. Sound effects (and there are plenty) are best experienced on a 3D-effects capable soundcard, such as a Soundblaster Live!",Enough user-created content to make it a worthwhile purchase,1055116800,7,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Developer: Awesome! Lemme have it!
Executive: Ok, for starters I'm thinking Grand Theft Auto meets Max Payne!
Developer: Ooh, I like it! Open world sandbox with bullet time shootouts, that could be great! So we'll keep it nice and gritty but with a little humor splashed through, like GTA and Max Payne?
Executive: No no no, we're going to do it up Robert Rodriguez style!
Developer: Ahh, I see. So more of a Mexican setting? Maybe a little more levity in general?
Executive: Right! Make it colorful with loud mariachi music during action scenes!
Developer: Ok, that seems a little tonally inconsistent, but if you want . . .
Executive: And the main character will have all kinds of crazy power up moves!!
Developer: Oh, so maybe we do a John Woo style spin while firing two guns move and maybe one where he gets the guitar case machine guns from Once Upon a Time in Mexico?
Executive: Exactly! Those . . . and MORE!! Let's have one where he uses his fingers as horns and rams enemies!!! Oooh! A sombrero of DEATH!
Developer: Ummm, ok, I guess we can do that.
Executive: And EXPLODING PINATAS!!!!
Developer: Wow. I don't know what to say.
Executive: We'll call them LOCO MOVES!! It'll be great!
Developer: Don't . . . don't you think that might be a little too . . . errrr . . . stereotypical?
Executive: AND TONY HAWK THAT S**T!!
Developer: . . . . . sir?
Executive: I want trick move counters and combo meters on the action scenes! Multipliers on gunfight tricks performed back to back! Those points will fuel the LOCO MOVES!!
Developer: Wow, that's actually a pretty good idea.
Executive: And just freaking steal the rewind option from Prince of Persia because it pleases me greatly!!!!
Developer: I . . . I don't think we can do that . . . it made sense in Prince of Persia due to the story . . .
Executive: . . . Don't care! Put it in!
At this point the developer tried to raise several other concerns, but was immediately silenced as the executive produced a guitar, sombrero and long moustache (from seemingly nowhere) that he proceeded to play and wear while singing old mariachi tunes at the top of his lungs.

At least that's what I REEEEALLY want to believe happened.

Either way, it's a really cool game with a lot of unique style and flair. I love the idea of being able to play a cartoony version of a Robert Rodriguez movie. The Loco Moves are actually really cool and the game does feature some amazing Latin/Mexican rock/hip-hop on the soundtrack that goes surprisingly well with all of the bright and flashy chaos. The driving segments are a little weak in my opinion, but then again I do tend to like the driving least in any sandbox game.

If you're a fan of John Woo style action games, but have found yourself wishing for one tailor made to suit your Rober Rodriguez-y moods . . . look no further, this is your game.

5.0,True,"05 18, 2011",A2IGEPJJYKMOWK,B002I0HBZW,Bullet Theory,"L.A. Noire is the latest title published by Rockstar, but the game was actually developed by Team Bondi. This is Team Bondi's first game, though some of the team were formerly from Sony's Team Soho, whom you'd best remember for The Getaway games on the Playstation 2. L.A. Noire is an exciting and somewhat revolutionary game in the open world genre. So let's investigate this one further and see if it it's top of class or just swimmin' with the fishes.

Positives:

- Revolutionary Facial Animation Tech - L.A. Noire is the first game to use Team Bondi's Motion Scan technology. This tech fully captures an actor's every movement and displays it on the character model in the game, which allows for very realistic movements that don't feel robotic at all.

- An Open World w/ Class - L.A. Noire offers a very large open world that is so detailed. You'll just stare in awe at its beauty. Every street is littered with detail.

- Story, Characters, Voice Acting - L.A. Noire is top of the class in every single one of these departments. The story is engaging, with very interesting characters and incredible voice acting to bring each character to life.

- Side Quests - While L.A. Noire isn't littered with side quests like Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption, it does have a more elegant and natural way of introducing side quests. When you're out on the main quest, you'll get a dispatch call warning you of a crime taking place, and then from there you can choose to either take on the side quest or completely ignore it. And if you do ignore the side quests, you can then finish them later. There are 40 side quests in total.

- Solid and Fun Gameplay - L.A. Noire's gameplay isn't as good as some other games, but it's still very solid overall. The gunplay and cover system are reliable and work well enough. The interrogation scenes are excellent and allow you to question people, look at their animations and try to read their movements to see if they're telling the truth, lying, or you can simply doubt them if you have no proof to prove that they're lying. The vehicles are easy to drive and don't feel very weighty. They feel more arcade-like, not sim-like.

- Overall Graphics - Just beautiful. Everything is so detailed in the world of L.A. Noire. Yes, there is some pop-in, but it doesn't take away from the overall stunning graphics.

Negatives:

- Some Technical Hiccups - A few framerate dips during cutscenes and gameplay, some environment and texture pop-in, and a few other minor issues.

Overall, L.A. Noire is a grand, sweeping epic of a game. It could've easily been nothing more than a tech demo for the impressive Motion Scan technology, but Team Bondi has made a game with superb narrative and solid gameplay in addition. Do not miss out on this masterpiece. It has a few flaws, but they're very minor in the grand scheme of things. L.A. Noire is a must play game.",L.A.

Only this time, a vampire artist named Brauner is controlling the power of the castle with paintings.  As Johnathan Morris and his friend Charlotte Orlean, your job will be to destroy these paintings as well as Brauner and any followers he may have.

The game begins with you entering Castlevania, and you're able to explore the castle as you like in the metroid style way that's been around since Symphany of the Night, and the exploration is complete with warps and hidden walls.  However, in exploring, there's a twist this time.  As you roam through the castle, you'll come across paintings.  When you do come across a painting, it's your job to jump inside and go through the particular area it takes you to.  This new aspect is fun simply for the fact that it means there is more exploration to be done in this Castlevania than previous entries.  Not only must you explore the castle, but several different paintings as well.  This really adds a lot of variety to the setting.  The first painting is a city, for example, and you'll soon find yourself exploring the desert as well as other areas.

The games environments look spectacular.  More detail is given to the backgrounds this time around, some effects being rendered in 3D.  They look pretty cool.  The game sports quite a bit of detail.  Some of the enemies look really good too.  There are over 100 enemies in Portrait of Ruin and some of them look absolutely stunning, especially some of the bosses you'll be fighting.  Needless to say, you won't tire of looking at the game any time soon.

Portrait of Ruin doesn't use the touch screen for much of anything, though.  Gameplay happens on the touch screen but unlike Dawn of Sorrow, you'll never have to use your stylus, and that's fine with me.  The map is also displayed on the top screen at all times, much like it was in Dawn of Sorrow.  This means no more toggling between the map and gameplay.

An interesting tweak to the gameplay is that you are now in control of two characters as opposed to one.  Johnathan and Charlotte.  Both characters are not the same, however, so don't expect that you'll never change.  Johnathan uses a whip and can use sub weapons such as knives while Charolotte specializes in several different types of magic.  As you progress through the game you'll run into a variety of enemies, some of which can only be killed with a specific character.

You can switch characters at any time, but you can also call your partner into battle for some assisstance.  The AI will control whichever character you are not controlling.  Also, when you call on your partner, the MP guage will become their life guage.  If they take too much damage they'll be dismissed.  The good news, however, is that your MP refills as you walk around so even if they're taken out it won't be long before you can call on them again.

The game is filled with puzzles to progress further, and you will indeed need both characters to go about some of them.  Again, this is unique to the Castlevania experience.  Early in the game, for example, you'll need to have one character stand on top of a statue while the other pushes, and you'll have to switch between them to get it going.

Another welcome addition to the gameplay are quests.  Early in the game you'll meet a character named Wind who will send you on quests.  These quests are optional, but doing them nets you rewards such as new techniques or rare items.  There's also a merchant for you to buy goods from.

Co-op play is another welcome addition to the game but it's extremely limited.  You can play either with a friend or with anyone from around the world, but you can't go through the main adventure, which is honestly a real drag.  The only thing you can do in co-op mode is fight all the bosses.  It's a boss rush mode with two players... that's it.  It's very disappointing that multiplayer is simply that.  Even worse, you both share a life guage, so if your partner dies, you suffer just as much.  You can find people through Nintendo Wi-Fi, which is really nice.  You can connect with anyone or you can enter a friend code, either way it doesn't matter.

Its unfortunate that Boss Rush mode isn't a whole lot of fun, though.  You get rewarded for completing it at least.  However, it would've been far better (and more fun) to go through the adventure mode with a friend.  Instead your limited to boss rush mode.

Shopping through the wi-fi network isn't bad, though.  When you connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi you select a monster and then the wi-fi connection seeks out a shop for you.  When you go in, you'll be able to buy items from people.  Likewise, you could set up the wi-fi and then sell items as well.

When selling items, however, one has to note that you do not get to choose what price you sell stuff for.  You can only sell it for the price that you could sell it to a normal merchant for.  This means that you can't find a really rare item, and then sell it to your best friend for one cent.  However, to the shopping's credit, if you decide to open up a store and someone buys from you, the item does not disappear from your inventory.  So if you have a really powerful weapon, and your friend buys it, you both can use it.  It's a fun way to find rare items, however the shop your given is completely random (if you decide not to go into a friend's shop).  So there's no guarantee you'll get a good one the first time.

Castlevania is known for having some of the best music in gaming.  Portrait of Ruin is no exception.  While it isn't as good as Dawn of Sorrow, it still has a lot of flare and passion that will absorb you.  Many tunes are indeed memorable.  Your characters also grunt when they swing their weapon or take damage.

In the end Portrait of Ruin is a great game.  The wi-fi is a little disappointing, but the game as a whole is just a lot of fun to play.  Any Castlevania fan will enjoy it.

I'm sure the purist won't appreciate the humor within the Row, but quit simply this game is fun and it replaces tediousness with all the elements that originally made the GTA series so great.  It has Jumps, Side Activities, Story Missions, Cribs (aka safe houses), building purchases and a whole lot more.

For years I have been hoping the game companies would grow up with the rest of us in regards to multiplayer.  Frag fests are fun with the right group, however when you want to tool around with a buddy or spend time gaming with the wife it just doesn't cut it.

Thank you Volition!  You've joined the ranks of Rockband and Left4Dead in providing us with a game that can be played as designed together. 80% of my time playing Saint's Row 2 has been riding shotgun with a buddy of mine and it's so much more fun than going at it alone.

With the complexity building an entire game supporting multiplayer there are some glitches and bugs.  Honestly in the 20 hours of playing with my buddy, I've been extremely happy at how few bugs we have encountered.  Yet they do exist and a few of them can be quite frustrating when it prevents completing a mission.

Bugs aside this game is a perfect addition to your collection. Especially if your looking for a sandbox game that you can explore and spend hours laughing with or at your best bud.",Coop done right!,1239753600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

Like other titles in the series, Tooie's story isn't deep, but it is charmingly funny. The bright colors and light jokes disguise some dark themes, such as murder, zombification, and even physical abuse. It's all in silly animated shtick, though. After being stuck under a rock for two years (and somehow surviving), a skeletal Gruntilda is freed, kills one of Banjo's friends, and decides to suck the life from the entire island so she can have a body again. Yet the game successfully thrives on humor, and is not afraid to cleverly break the fourth wall from time to time.

Gameplay is very fun, and this is one of the best adventure titles on the Nintendo 64. Those who dislike collectathons might grow tired of it, but the humor should still keep them playing. Even the multiplayer minigames can provide endless fun.

Replayability is not incredibly high, as it is a long adventure game, but chances are you'll want to play through it again eventually.

review update: been playing on and off two weeks still having a blast! i came on here to check reviews out of curiosity and it saddens me to see such misserable people leaving one star reviews, most of the one star reviews consist of people who
1) didn't get the physicalgame delivered on time and didn't get in on early access
2) people who could not loadthe game because their computer isn't good enough
3) people who like spoon feeding gime easy easy boring grind mmos

thjose one star reviews are essentially junk reviews just read over the majority and u will see its mostly just people complaining they cant run the game on their pc or they cant connect to the services.

i have fios and a crazy rig, this game always loads always logs in and always provides me with hours of entertainment, if you cant affprd 15$ a month u have more pressing issues to solve and shoukd spend less time writing dumb reviews and more time looking for a better job.

the following was my original review and i still stand by it, thia game starts to shine more and more the higher lvl u get i plan on making tons of alts this game will provide an easy year of entertainmernt imo.

Where to start?
WHAT THIS GAME DOES DIFFERENT:
1) No boring ""kill 50 frogs and come back to me quests"" , Almost EVERY quest is simple, strait forward and scripted with nice voice-overs lore, characters, and story telling, with scripted boss fights (even single player quests or open world bosses are scripted EVENTS!) In terms of Questing NO MMO HAS QUESTING THAT IS MORE FUN AND ENGAGING THAN THE QUESTING IN THIS GAME.
No boring quests here, everything is fun, interesting, unique (you never feel like ""o i have done this before"") every quest feels like its a unique quest different from all the other quests you have done before and it consists of a nice mix of different style of quests.
""kill this guy take his head""
""Kill these things that have been bugging me"" (very few of these and they are quick)
""Steal this for me""
""Help me free this person and so and so""
""Help me stop this horrible thing from happening""
""Disable this, Break that""
""Discover this area and report back"" etc

GOOD MIX OF QUESTS
2) VERY FREE ROAM  , at no point do you feel like you are ""on rails"" or ""forced to do something to progress"" everything is very organic and natural, and you simply encounter adventures and tasks during your regular free roaming and exploration of the world, IE: most of your questing happens when your just roaming around casual, you see someone injured on the way and you DECIDE to help them, then it spins off into a series of RELATED quests with scripted events and back story, SIMPLY AWESOME QUESTING EXPERIENCE/VERY OPEN/FREE feeling.

3)Skill leveling and class creation, Where to start, YOU HAVE GREAT CHOICES, YES!!! CHOICES while building your character, its not like world of warcraft where you pretty much pick a class and you are stuck using Frost Bolt from level 1 to 90, no BS like that, you  build your character YOUR WAY.... no ""progression on rails"" World of warcraft is boring because they spoon feed you and force you to build your character a certain way, ESO does not do this, its great your character genuinely FEELS LIKE YOUR CHARACTER!!!!

4) Graphics, They are BEAUTIFUL, sure they could be more crazy with crazy effects and bla bla bla but you don't need that crap

I FEEL GUILTY PLAYING THIS GAME BECAUSE I ONLY PAYED 70$ for it.
I FEEL LIKE I AM GETTING WAY TOO GOOD OF A DEAL PLAYING THIS GAME, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER GAMES LIKE DIABLO III where you pretty much HAVE NOTHING TO DO FROM LEVEL 1 lol

Anyway, THE GAME IS AWESOME anyone hating on this game, simply hasn't given it a chance, you have to play to atleast level 4~6 to get a real feel for the direction the game is going.
Its a great game, I almost want to just buy it for people, i wish it came with some free trial keys for friends, because everyone wants to try the game but we have all been burned by crap titles before that we are actually afraid to trust games nowadays since you have companies like Activision Blizzard putting out JUNK back to back just to make sales.

Anyway, I wish I got around to PVP (havent done that yet) to review that, when I am higher level I will def update this with my PvP experience, and I expect it to be just as good as my PVE experience so-far.

Give this game a chance, chances are you won't be disappointed!
Im not gona call this the ""wow killer"" but for me atleast, its a TON more fun and interesting than WoW but you have a lot of fan-boys that will band-wagon against you if you call it that, so i won't even bother cause I don't want to get into a troll nerd fest fight over an MMo thats ten years old.",I LOVE THIS GAME,1397088000,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
