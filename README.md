## Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing for Marketing
- As part of a project, I downloaded Amazon reviews dataset and created a personalized dataset by analyzing the reviews. The objective was to determine whether the customers liked or disliked the video game they purchased by labeling each review with a sentiment score ranging from -1 to 1.
- To assess the effectiveness of my sentiment analyzer, I compared the sentiment scores with the review ratings. I then evaluated the performance of my sentiment analyzer to ensure accurate labeling of the reviews.
- Additionally, I explored other methods of sentiment analysis and classified the reviews into positive, negative, and neutral categories to gain insights into how customers evaluated the video game they purchased.
